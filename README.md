# Project-Indiana
A Collection and culmination of all my code and internet archaeology efforts - primarily focused upon accrete.

## Accrete
Accrete's origin dates back to the late 60's when Stephen H. Dole published "Formation of Planetary Systems by Aggregation: A Computer Simulation". It grew to prominence in the 90's after a recreated version of the source code based on a susequent paper by Martyn J. Fogg was released into the fertile ground that was the now defunct USML mailing list.

Since then there have been numerous versions, and the work on this module is primarily focused on preserving the timeline of events that I have pieced together from my experimentation in my other github project.
