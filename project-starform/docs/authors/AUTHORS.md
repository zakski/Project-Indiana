# Authors of Implementations and Interested Parties.

## Intro

This file contains a brief description of each examined implementations. More detailed readmes, if they exist, will be deposited into the folder containing 
this file.

Additionally I will list the names of interested parties that never released their own version in here, as a way of tracking them in case they pop up later.

## Implementations

###[ACRETE](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2649232823724285381&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5)

- Author: Stephen H. Dole
- Language: Most likely FORTRAN due to it being written for a IBM 7044.
- Year: 1969

Stephen H. Dole wrote the original program and research paper that detailed the solar system formation simulation code. He was a prolific astronomy 
researcher and whilst I have not recovered his original source code; I have a reliable recreation of his original engine based on his papers that exist online, 
with the exception of the random number generator that he used.

###[Silicon Creation](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9385174980475541539&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5)

- Author: Martyn J. Fogg
- Language: BBC Basic
- Year: 1985

Martyn J. Fogg wrote a subsequent research paper that attempted to vary the mass of the star and build up information about the potential atmosphere of each 
planet in the generated system. Mat Burdick's implementation is based on this.

###[ACCRETE 1a/1b](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9385174980475541539&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5)

- Author: Dave Allen
- Language: IBM Basic
- Year: 1988

Dave Allen claims to have written variations of Accrete, 1a to allow captured moons rather than coalesce straight away. The second one, 1b, an attempt to 
simulate moon systems, as well as potentially an original version. Cannot currently find any source code of these programs online so this branch is 
considered orphaned right now, since I don't know where they fit into the bigger picture.
