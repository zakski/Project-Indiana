The first 4 are source code for random system generation routines and fractal
landscapes.  The 9 universe files are past messages, rec.games.frp/programmer
articles relevant,.....

I also put in Universe10 and Universe11 as well as Actual and the
Shebs thing (what shuld I call it?) but I havn't removed the
mail headers yet or looked at them.


USML Second ftp archive:
Name:           Universal Simulation Mailing List (usml) ftp site
Address:        topgun.agps.lanl.gov (192.12.184.4)
Info Updated:   25-Feb-1991
Notes:          Once upon a time, some net.people made a joke about writing a
                program or two that simulated the Universe. Ho ho ho. Pretty
                funny. But other people took them seriously and thus was born
                the short lived mailing list called usml, and thus were written
                a number of programs which simulated various parts of the
                universe. There are subsector generators for Traveller, star
                system generators using several methods, and plate tectonic
                generators to generate random land masses (not very pretty).

                Here are the contents of pub/usml:
