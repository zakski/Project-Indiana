My interest in galactic formation is practically nil--I'm really only
interested in continent level and below.  I will also confess to a
real disbelief in the use of computer simulation to produce cultures.
However, I could be wrong, and some help with small-scale climatology
would be great.  Count me in, then, at least in a small way.

(At the moment, the major campaign areas have the climates of the three
places I've lived for prolonged periods.  The party doesn't know it,
but they just had a grand tour of the Chugach Mountains, just east of
senic Anchorage, Alaska.  They found it a bit cold for their liking....)

If you're on this list but have no interest, we'd appreciate it
if you could email Jim to tell him.

I will post summaries of the discussion to both rec.games.frp and
rec.games.programmer under the topic Universe Simulator.  Here is
a summary of what has happened so far.

ACTUAL hoax - "David M. Brown", r.g.p 126 (25 Jul), 130 (28 Jul)
Call for discussion - Mark Stevans, r.g.p 146 (31 Jul)
Statement of intent - Dave Allen, r.g.p (early Aug), posted
  by Mark Stevans.  We are trying to write a program that 
  simulates the evolution of a large number of star systems,
  showing the development of intelligent life, invention of culture,
  and inter-relationships of interstellar civilizations.  Key points
  are the variety of lifeforms, differing rates and types of technological
  development, and a variety of interaction modes for alien contacts.
  The resulting program would be something you would sit back and
  watch, like the Scientific American game Life.  Each simulation
  timestep, the universe would get a little older.
Description of Universe Simulator - Dave Allen, r.g.p 165 (8 Aug)
  Basically, it starts out with an empty universe full of dust.
  Stars are born, live their life on the main sequence, and supernova.
  Later stars have higher metallicity.  Each star is created with
  planets, each having a temperature, atmosphere and (possibly) life.
  Simulation uses die-rolling rather than astrophysical formulae,
  is written in ~300 lines of Amiga Basic code, and runs in 6 minutes.
Breakdown of simulation levels in the Universe Simulator, Dave Allen, to
  Jim Meritt.  There are really three separate simulations involved
  here:  development of planetary systems and stars; growth of a single
  intelligent race; interaction of starfaring races with other races.
Description of astrophysical-formula simulations, Jim Meritt, to Dave
  Allen, 19 Aug 88.  Made up a random generator that pumped out stars
  with a distribution similiar to a galactic arm.  Lifted a condensate
  version of planetary creation to derive size and probable core/crust
  composition.  Used the star mass and the distance/composition to get
  planetary masses.  Used star temp and the distance/mass of the planet
  to get probable atmosphere composition & pressure (ev calculations,
  liquid water temp range, dust, that type of stuff).  Made random
  generators for stuff like moons & rings.  For terrestrial-type surface
  conditions, there is a reasonable amount of climatology that is not too
  numeric intensive.
Offer of working PC Basic programs, from Dave Allen, to Jim Meritt,
  18 Aug 88.  A working condensation simulator, based on a paper by
  Stephen Dole, that generates planetary systems given star mass
  and initial dust density.  I've made two modified versions of these,
  one to allow captured moons, and one to generate a moon system
  given planet mass.  An atmosphere generator based on papers by M.H.
  Hart which simulates the development of Earth's atmosphere with
  parameters to generate the atmosphere of any terrestrial planet"
Description of climatology system, from Jim Meritt, to Dave Allen, 
  19 Aug 88.  You can get climatology from (distance from sun, length of
  year and day, and axial tilt), but you have to throw in things like
  distance from ocean (for habitable) in direction of prevailing winds
  (planet-wide hadley cells for prevailing zones).  For microclimates
  ("local weather") you sorta gotta cheat (statistical separation from
  predicted climate)  I think I have an article that has a basic
  program that dies the planetwide climate from orbital characteristics
  someplace.  Or maybe the other way (climate to orbit).
Wish list for climatology program, from Dave Allen to Jim Meritt, 
  26 Aug 88.  Suggests  raster map of a planet, 70 x 210 pixels.  Each
  pixel is either land, mountain or ocean.  Derive temperature ranges
  by season and time of day from known parameters.  Determine global
  atmospheric circulation.  Determine rainfall for each pixel,
  accounting for rain shadows.  Determine ocean currents, microclimates.
Description of using tectonics to generate world maps, Mark Isaak, r.g.f
  2284, 24 Aug 88.  Divide globe into 20 plates, some continent, most
  ocean.  Give each plate a random direction and velocity; let them move.
  Change the directions every once in a while.  Erode the mountains.
More description of tectonics, Mark Isaak, to Dave Allen, 26 Aug 88.
  (Describes a complete method for generating world maps by hand)
List of references to simulations of politics, human behavior and
  international relations, from Jim Meritt, to Dave Allen and Stephen
  Pearl, 26 Aug 88.  (Not included)
Description of universe simulator, from Stan Shebs, article 276 of r.g.p
  (26 Aug 88).  He has a document describing the basics of a simulator
  for a universe.  Getting the basic concepts right is pretty hard -
  for instance how to do 3D models of planets, how to track EM radiation
  at various frequencies, and how to handle energy/info transfer of
  various sorts, without all of this requiring a building full of Class
  VI machines to run reasonably.

Please add me to your mailing list for the universe simulator item.  While I
don't really have a lot of information that might be helpful, I am interested
in finding out how to make my computer build a universe for me...

However, I hope this isn't going to be too heavily scientifically oriented.
I'd like tables and stuff; I don't want to see programs saying "Simulation of
Hydrosphere of a Star" or things like that.  I want to be able to examine a
planet orbiting a certain star and see that it's a tropical world, etc.; I
don't want (immediately) complete breakdowns of core compositions and stuff,
or stuff too technical to be used in games...

I'd like to join this project.  I would prefer to work on physical rather
than biological or political aspects.  Specifically, I consider myself
qualified to program astrophysics and planetary science (formation and
composition I can handle, I could make a good effort at meteorology, but
I would not be good at plate tectonics or geology).

I took this off of the comp.sources.games in Jan 27.  Here is the README,
for anyone who is interested.

Usage of Traveller Programs
===========================

Create Two subdirectories sysgen & sysprint : Then unbundle the files.
The directories will contain :

sysgen:
Makefile const.h glob.c glob.h init.c main.c planets.c print.c rnd.c sats.c st.c
stuff.h sub.c support.c system.c types.h

sysprint:
Makefile mass stars.ps tr22 trconv trmult trmult.c ts

To generate complete listings of star systems (an allegedly complete
implementation of Single-Star Systems according to the rules in Book 6)
it is necessary to compile the files in sysgen (by typing make) and then
running the program st. Be warned this produces voluminous output.

To generate a postscript file representing the star system, run st with
the -m option. This produces a file which lists the major features in the
system.

The command trconv file in the sysprint directory will then
produce a postscript file. Trading routes can be added to the system
description file by the DM as required.

Multiple systems can be printed using the trmult command. For example

trmult 2 2 stars.ps file1 file2 file3 file4

will place 4 systems on a piece of paper. But be warned: the order is not
the most obvious imaginable.


NOTE: the st command takes an argument which is an integer defining the
system. This allows the st program to be run many times with predictable
results.

tr22 & mass are historical examples of using trmult.

Jim,
Three things.  First, I got the stuff you us-mailed me; it looks pretty
neat.  I will reverse-engineer it and post a summary of the relevant equations
probably next week.  Second, here's a possible reference for you re atmosphere
and ocean circulation:

_Advances in Geophysics_, Academic Press, a yearly publication.  The 1983 volume
(ISBN 0-12-018825-2, volume 25 in the series, edited by Barry Salzman) is
entitled Theory of Climate.  Volume 28 A and B (ISBN 0-12-018828-8 and
0-120018849-X, 1985, edited by Syukuro Manabe) is entitled Issues in
Atmospheric and Oceanic Modelling.  My library has them under QC801.A283.
I didn't read any of the contents, just the titles.  They _all_ looked useful.

Third, here's some mail re Marty Shannon.  I haven't tried mailing him, though.

This actually doesn't generate the most realistic-looking map, because the
ridges generated by the first "lift" tend to stick around to later stages.
The effect is to have two large ridges (or valleys) which run horizontal and
vertical to the map coordinates, and successively smaller ones on the sides.

This effect can be hidden by increasing the relative importance of the
successive smaller lifts, but only by making the terrain extremely rough.
A better technique is described in one of Mandelbrot's books: pick a "random"
line on your square grid (randomly oriented in position and angle); raise all
the terrain to one side of your line by a small step. Repeat until well done,
subtract the same amount from all points (usually half the number of repeti-
tions). The terrain can also be run through a function to make it not all
one mountain, such as a f(i,j) = f(i,j)^3 type function.

This works even better on a sphere, where you pick a random hemisphere and
increase its radius by a small step. Repeat. If you store all of your
steps into a file separately, then you can zoom in on any particular section
of the sphere to produce a map with increased accuracy. Sea level can be
adjusted as desired to sink continents, etc.

Granted, this is a bit compute-intensive, but it does generate nice worlds,
and if you're going to generate your maps on a world, you might as well
do it right! :->

I remember now: Benoit Mandelbrot, _Fractals: Form, Chance, and Dimension_ ~1978

	I peeked at the universe4 file, and thought I'd mention
why I'm interested in your topic.  A couple of weeks ago, I dug
up some old (1982ish) listings of my attempt to automate the
world generation in SPI's "Universe" RPG.  I decided to pick it up
again and finish it, since now I have access to more graphics
than I did then.  I found myself wanting more "realism" than was
available using their tables and rules but was unsure of where to
begin changing it.  My old astronomy texts weren't much help.  Then
someone pointed out the news item describing your group.
	As I mentioned, I haven't read all the data yet, so it's
unclear to me whether you plan a group project or are just exchanging
helpful hints.
