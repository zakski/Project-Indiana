As I am planning on using all the information I gather here in computerizing
a Traveller Universe, I would appreciate if anyone on the mailing list with
PD code for planetary, stellar generation, dust density, moon systems and
other miscellaneous information would mail it to me.  Also, programs that
generate stellar maps and planetary info from different game systems is
appreciated.  As far as Traveller goes, I am currently using only the world
generation scheme and not the system generation scheme.  If we can somehow
manage to get ye olde godling generator/simulator from a big bang system
going, that is what would be ideal.

The reason, I am asking for this is because I came in on the discussion
late and have missed some stuff.  Also, our site does not archive postings
or source files.

I am working on an Amiga 1000 and if necessary will port the code I acquire
to it and will mail to anyone who is interested.

The main things I am interested in are as follows:


Description of Universe Simulator - Dave Allen, r.g.p 165 (8 Aug)
  Basically, it starts out with an empty universe full of dust.
  Stars are born, live their life on the main sequence, and supernova.
  Later stars have higher metallicity.  Each star is created with
  planets, each having a temperature, atmosphere and (possibly) life.
  Simulation uses die-rolling rather than astrophysical formulae,
  is written in ~300 lines of Amiga Basic code, and runs in 6 minutes.
Description of astrophysical-formula simulations, Jim Meritt, to Dave
  Allen, 19 Aug 88.  Made up a random generator that pumped out stars
  with a distribution similiar to a galactic arm.  Lifted a condensate
  version of planetary creation to derive size and probable core/crust
  composition.  Used the star mass and the distance/composition to get
  planetary masses.  Used star temp and the distance/mass of the planet
  to get probable atmosphere composition & pressure (ev calculations,
  liquid water temp range, dust, that type of stuff).  Made random
  generators for stuff like moons & rings.  For terrestrial-type surface
  conditions, there is a reasonable amount of climatology that is not too
  numeric intensive.
Offer of working PC Basic programs, from Dave Allen, to Jim Meritt,
  18 Aug 88.  A working condensation simulator, based on a paper by
  Stephen Dole, that generates planetary systems given star mass
  and initial dust density.  I've made two modified versions of these,
  one to allow captured moons, and one to generate a moon system
  given planet mass.  An atmosphere generator based on papers by M.H.
  Hart which simulates the development of Earth's atmosphere with
  parameters to generate the atmosphere of any terrestrial planet"
Description of climatology system, from Jim Meritt, to Dave Allen, 
  19 Aug 88.  You can get climatology from (distance from sun, length of
  year and day, and axial tilt), but you have to throw in things like
  distance from ocean (for habitable) in direction of prevailing winds
  (planet-wide hadley cells for prevailing zones).  For microclimates
  ("local weather") you sorta gotta cheat (statistical separation from
  predicted climate)  I think I have an article that has a basic
  program that dies the planetwide climate from orbital characteristics
  someplace.  Or maybe the other way (climate to orbit).
Description of universe simulator, from Stan Shebs, article 276 of r.g.p
  (26 Aug 88).  He has a document describing the basics of a simulator
  for a universe.  Getting the basic concepts right is pretty hard -
  for instance how to do 3D models of planets, how to track EM radiation
  at various frequencies, and how to handle energy/info transfer of
  various sorts, without all of this requiring a building full of Class
  VI machines to run reasonably.
Sean Malloy (malloy@nprdc.arpa) sent us a set of programs to generate star
  systems from the SFRPG Other Suns.  There are four; three in Pascal and one
  in C.  They generate one "hex" (1000 ly across) and fill it with stars
  and planets according to the charts and tables in the game.
Jim Meritt (jwm@stdc.jhuapl.edu) has posted about fifty journal references, 
  many from Scientific American, concerning scientific efforts to model
  planet creation, atmospheric development and circulation, climate, development
  of life, sociological and cultural development,
Jim Meritt also dug up a set of programs to generate systems for Traveller,
  originally posted to comp.sources.games.
Matt Burdick (burdick@hpindda.hp.com) has written a program in Turbo Pascal
  based on a set of papers by Martin Fogg in Journal of the British Interplanetary
  Society (JBIS).  The program uses astrophysical theories to simulate
  the creation of a star system, with results that look much like our solar
  system.  He posted (rec.games.programmer article 225) a sample output,
  and it has a number of details about each planet like size, gravity,
  est. surface temperature, albedo and so on.
Andrew Folkins (mnetor!alberta!andrew@uunet.uu.net) has implemented Dole's
  accretion simulator (upon which Fogg's simulator was based) in C on the Amiga.

Thanks in advance (Hopefully you can reach me by mail, when that looks like
it is working, I'll refrain from posting these requests.)

Jim,

I noticed that the current issue of SCIENCE has an interesting article
on climate models (and how well they match actual climate patterns)
which might be of interest in the universe simulating effort.

Also...I don't know if you have access to back issues of ALARUMS & EXCURSIONS
or not, but a couple of years ago one of its contributors was discussing
a planetary generation program that he was working on. From what I recall
of the discussion he had gotten at some of it running on a PC. [The name
of the writer is Steve Gilham. I don't think he has any net access right now
, but if you're interested you might try the snails -- 23 Trinity Close,
Haslingfield, Cambs, CB3 7LS, UK. From my dim memories his work was based
on Dole, though updated with his own work/study in astro-physics.]

For this step I would use a normal (a.k.a. Gaussian) deviate, not just a
random number.  This is the "standard" method, and it definitely looks more
realistic.  For more info on Gaussian deviates, see "Numerical Recipes" or
"Numerical Recipes in C".

Also, if you want a prepackaged routine for making mountains, you might want
to check out my SPD package.  Though used for testing ray tracers, it has
code for a fractal mountain generator and a tree generator.  Attached is
my boilerplate paragraph about the package.  Mark VandeWettering is also
making the package available via ftp - check comp.graphics for details.

All for now,

Eric Haines, who is not John Saponara


        The "Standard Procedural Database" package is a set of 6 database
    generators, including the recursive tetrahedron, a fractal mountain, and
    a tree grower.  For images produced by the databases and more information
    on the concept, see the article in IEEE Computer Graphics & Applications,
    November 1987, p. 3-5.  To get the package, send mail to Netlib (which has
    a lot of other worthwhile free stuff) at `netlib@anl-mcs.arpa' or at
    `research!netlib'.  Send the one line message `Send Haines from Graphics'
    and the program which receives your message will send you a copy of the
    package.  If you send the message (on a separate line) `Send Index' you'll
    get the index and more information about Netlib in general.  Eric Grosse
    and Jack Dongarra run Netlib.  I (Eric Haines) simply wrote the SPD package.

	The NFF format is a very basic format that allows the specification
    of the scene's geometry, lighting, and the viewpoint.  Polygons, polygonal
    patches, spheres, cylinders, cones, and tori are presently supported.
    It is meant to be minimal and simple, so that users can write a translator
    program to convert this format into their own package-specific format.
    Since the focus of the SPD package is on testing ray tracers, the format
    is limited in many ways.  For example, matrices are not supported.  The
    file contains raw geometric data and not much else (e.g. light source
    intensities cannot be specified, as this parameter has no effect upon
    how fast the scene can be ray-traced).

	The newest version is 2.4 (check the mountain.c module to see if yours
    is labeled as such).

It would be helpful if we had some idea what the different people are interested
in.  There appear to be groups like planetary development a'la Dole, plate
tectonics, climatology, biological development, geopolitical development,...
I've tried to make "subgroups", but it's too hard to tell most - a lot of 
requests and too few submissions.  I was interested in the planetary development
initially, but it seems covered enough so I'm going to see what sense I can
make out of climatology.  So far all I can tell might be interested in that is

Subject: Who Am I
Status: R

Jim Meritt suggested everybody say a few words about who they are and
what they're interested in.  I think it's a good idea.

My background is in Computer Science and role-playing games.  I've
read a lot of journal articles on simulation of star systems and
planetary systems.  I corresponded with a guy in England who had coded
some programs (Dole's simulator and Hart's atmosphere simulator)
and played with them.

My main interest is in getting a program that generates a lot of detail
about a large section of space, including populating them with
interesting aliens.  This would be a background generator for a really
neato computer role-playing game.

Right now I am trying various ideas related to writing a tectonic
simulator.  I want to generate real-looking world maps for hundreds
of worlds.  Fractals don't make it for me because they're too random.
Drawing them by hand isn't practical for hundreds of worlds.

Jim,

I will incorporate your comments re the summary next time around.

Re sub-mailing lists, I personally would like to be on all of them, and
I think you would also.  I bet everybody would be interested in at
least listening to all the sublists.  For this reason I suggest we 
leave it the way it is, with just the one big list.

Sorry, I don't.  Problem with 5 degree increments is that your cells are 
not the same size everywhere; at the equator they're wide, near the pole
they are very narrow.  This is the problem I am running into with respect
to the tectonic simulator.  Trying to keep a plate the same size as it
wanders around is harder than I thought.

Suggest you use the idea I suggested earlier, about keeping each cell the
same size and having to figure out what cell is north or south.  I'm
playing with variations on this idea; so far nothing I have satisfies me.
I'll keep you up to date.

Subject: Fractal Topology
Status: R


I think that the "correct" way to generate fractal topology on a square
may be to do the FFT of a noise function which falls off as (fx^2+fy^2)^H,
where H is the smoothness parameter (0<H<1). The various methods that
have been described by others seem to all be of the H=1/2 variety, which
generate landscapes of fractal dimension 2.5. Apparently real landscape
varies between 2.1 and 2.3, so this is why the posted methods generate
landscape which is too rough. Reference: Mandelbrot, 1977, _Fractals:
Form, Chance, and Dimension_.

Now, my next question: does anyone have a good FFT algorithm available?
In this case, "good"="short, well written, in C or Pascal"
rather than "complex and hyperfast, in FORTRAN". If so, please send it to me;
I'd like to try this out.

I think a key in this whole simulation topic is not to get too caught
up with the "way things actually work"; but concentrate on techniques
which will allow outcomes to be calculated which approximate the
desired outcomes. This is just off the top of my head, but I once saw
a simple explanation of the world climate that related it all to the
thermodynamics of air masses.  It suggested that there were areas on
the globe which naturally cooled air, and there were areas which
naturally warmed air.  Where masses of warm, moisture-laden air meets
colder air, it rains.  Where warm, dry air is rising adjacent to
cooler concentration of air, the cool air is drawn in to replace it,
creating frequent winds.  You get the idea.  It seems fairly
straight-forward to predict where these areas of heating and cooling
occur based on geographical features of the land and/or ocean.

Is this a starting point?
