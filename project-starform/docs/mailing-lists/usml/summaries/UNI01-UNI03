Here is a fairly long msg I plan to post to rec.games.programmer and
rec.games.frp.  Please let me know what you think of it; I won't post
it till I get comments from you.  Specifically, who is
pearl@aramis.rutgers.edu?

> Call for discussion - Mark Stevans, r.g.p 146 (31 Jul)

>   Basically, it starts out with an empty universe full of dust.
>   Stars are born, live their life on the main sequence, and supernova.
>   Later stars have higher metallicity.  Each star is created with
>   planets, each having a temperature, atmosphere and (possibly) life.
>   Simulation uses die-rolling rather than astrophysical formulae,
>   is written in ~300 lines of Amiga Basic code, and runs in 6 minutes.
> Breakdown of simulation levels in the Universe Simulator, Dave Allen, to
>   Jim Meritt.  There are really three separate simulations involved
>   here:  development of planetary systems and stars; growth of a single
>   intelligent race; interaction of starfaring races with other races.
> Description of astrophysical-formula simulations, Jim Meritt, to Dave
>   Allen, 19 Aug 88.  Made up a random generator that pumped out stars
>   with a distribution similiar to a galactic arm.  Lifted a condensate
