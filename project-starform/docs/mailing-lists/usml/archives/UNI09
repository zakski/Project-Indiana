Don't forget coral reefs...not the most prevalent form on Earth,
but, if you wanted to tweek your animal kingdom, it could be
a big factor.  Also, coral reefs aren't that old, on a planetary
scale, so they would probably be one of the last things to add.

Subject: Universal Simulator List

This is a long note describing my efforts towards a tectonic
simulator.  What I want to have is a program which is fun to watch; you
start it up and it does an animation of a randomly-generated planet,
showing how its continents drift.  I'd like it to have a number of
parameters so that it could be run for planets like earth - parameters
such as fraction of water, planet size, and so on.  It should have some
kind of text output so you can save results either to look at them
later or to add more details, notably erosion, river action, and
glacier action.

Right now I don't have anything I think is worthwhile.  I have a
program that works but I don't like the results. I also have some ideas
about a completely different technique, with which I will start to
experiment soon.  More on that later.

Here's some info about the program I wrote.  It's based on some
conversations with Mark Isaak and a lot of thinking.  This program gets
a supercontinent splitting up all right.  You can see rifts forming,
and you can see mountains on coasts, but it doesn't look very real.
Still looks too random.  It's about 100 lines of C (not counting
simple graphics support code), and I can't get the code to the net.
These are the steps it carries out.

Take a cylinder the size of the earth (spheres are harder).  Divide it
up into 100 x 100 squares.  Each square can be either ocean, land, or
mountain.  Draw an initial supercontinent.  Right now this is just a
rectangle; one would want to use a fractal technique to get a blot.

Randomly place 12 "seeds" on the surface; each seed will be the center
of a "plate".  Each of the 10,000 squares belongs to the plate whose seed
it is closest to.  That guarantees that each plate is a convex polygon
(all of its corners are less than 180 degrees).  You want that so you
can avoid, for example, making a "V" - shaped plate drift sideways.

Assign each plate a random velocity in x and a random velocity in y, each
in the range 1-10.  Each timestep, everything on the plate drifts 1/10 of
its velocity in squares.  Every 10 timesteps, change the velocities 
slightly.  Thus, the plates don't move but they make like conveyor belts
for the continents.  Raise mountains along the leading edges of the 
continents.  Repeat for an infinite number of timesteps.


I have come across some new ideas for a tectonic simulator.  The ideas
came from a paper Jim Meritt told me about:

> You really want to read "The Supercontinent Cycle" by Nance, Worsley, &
> Moody, Scientific American, July 1988  before you get very far.  I will
> want to use the time since the last supercontinent breakup as part of
> the climatology model.   Besides, it gives nice timing & pattern for
> continental drifting.

I read it this morning.  It is really cool!  I've been reading some
older refs on the subject and I couldn't get a good picture of how all
the mechanisms for continental drift work together.  This article did
it for me.  If you're at all interested in the history of Earth on the
geological timescale, you should read it.

Here's what the article says, in a nutshell.  They have a theory
that says every 500 million years, a supercontinent breaks up, drifts
apart, then drifts back together.  The sea level changes in a fixed way.
Changes in the sea level lead to glaciation.  Changes in the sea level
also have implications for the rate of evolution.  They present evidence
from fossil records, ages of mountains, and geological indications of
historical sea level.  I found it to be very convincing.

Here's the sort of thing I'm thinking about to simulate this.  Generate
a supercontinent (again probably a rectangle at first).  Generate random
fissure lines running through the supercontinent.  Really only kind of
random; you can't have things too concave, and I don't think you want 
junctions more complicated than T's (no X's).  Take the fissured parts
of the supercontinent and drift them for a while, with decreasing 
velocity.  Then let the velocity reverse itself (more or less).  Build
mountains when the continents crash into each other while reassembling
into a supercontinent.

I guess I'm not sure how you get mountains around the Pacific ocean
based on this.  Right now, our continents are drifting away from the
Atlantic.  If there's just flat oceanic crust on the Pacific side, why
are the Rockies and the Andes there?

Well, that's all for now.

Jim,

Please add me to your list.  I am primarily interested in computer
simulation of world creation, but am also interested in the other
topics I've seen being discussed.

Also, I'ld really like to see the journal references you appearently
posted.  And where can I get a hold of King's program?

My own contribution, for those who want to design their own languages:

The book _Language Aquisition Made Practical_ has a very complete
section on phonemics and general principles of sentence structure.

The phonemics section describes almost every sound that can possibly be
made by the human mouth, and how different languages prefer different
combinations of phonemes, which contributes to "foreign accents."

(For example, in Spanish, the phoneme /s/, when it comes at the
beginning of the word, is always followed by a vowel.  Thus, when native
Spanish speakers try to say words like "street," it comes out
"estreet.")

The structure section talks about the basic things any grammar has to
deal with, like making reflexive statements or questions.

I don't have the author and publication data for _L.A.M.P._, but you
should be able to look it up in _Books in Print._  A few years ago,
_Dragon_ had a series of articles on language design that were quite
good, but back issues of _Dragon_ are probably a lot harder to come by.

Finally, I can make a tiny contribution to the list.  The pacific plate is 
currently in the process of sliding under the continental plate that we're
sitting on.  this causes the sierras and the chocolate mountains, and i'm
not sure what else.  I dunno bout south america, or the rockies.

Something your simulation should tke into account is the relative thickness of
the different plates, and how that affects their momenta, and therefore how
their velocities change.  For example, were the india chunk younger (and 
lighter) it would not have been able to plow into asia with such striking
results.

Summary of discussion on the unofficial "Universe Simulation" mailing list,
Aug 31 - Sept 7:

Sean Malloy (malloy@nprdc.arpa) sent us a set of programs to generate star
  systems from the SFRPG Other Suns.  There are four; three in Pascal and one
  in C.  They generate one "hex" (1000 ly across) and fill it with stars
  and planets according to the charts and tables in the game.
There was some discussion about using fractal geometry to create terrain;
  several people mentioned programs they had written to generate random terrain
  using fractals.  Edwin King (elk@cbnews.att.com) gave us a working program
  in C to generate rectangular pieces of terrain.
Jim Meritt (jwm@stdc.jhuapl.edu) has posted about fifty journal references, 
  many from Scientific American, concerning scientific efforts to model
  planet creation, atmospheric development and circulation, climate, development
  of life, sociological and cultural development,
Jim Meritt also dug up a set of programs to generate systems for Traveller,
  originally posted to comp.sources.games.  Here is a quote from the README file:
  "To generate complete listings of star systems (an allegedly complete
  implementation of Single-Star Systems according to the rules in Book 6)
  it is necessary to compile the files in sysgen (by typing make) and then
  running the program st. Be warned this produces voluminous output."  The
  programs look pretty complete and are written in C.
Matt Burdick (burdick@hpindda.hp.com) has written a program in Turbo Pascal
  based on a set of papers by Martin Fogg in Journal of the British Interplanetary
  Society (JBIS).  The program uses astrophysical theories to simulate
  the creation of a star system, with results that look much like our solar
  system.  He posted (rec.games.programmer article 225) a sample output,
  and it has a number of details about each planet like size, gravity,
  est. surface temperature, albedo and so on.
Andrew Folkins (mnetor!alberta!andrew@uunet.uu.net) has implemented Dole's
  accretion simulator (upon which Fogg's simulator was based) in C on the Amiga.
Mary Kuhner (jyamato@cory.berkeley.edu ?) brought up some questions related 
  to realistic patterns of weather and population density, and aggregation
  of small political units into larger ones.
Brian Bowers (cs2551af@charon.unm.edu) made some suggestions about weather
  patterns and historical development of nations, and Edwin Wiles
  (netxcom!ewiles@uunet.uu.net) made some more suggestions.  Darren Sinster
  gave us a whole list of relationships between landscape and weather
  patterns.

    On the subject of mapmaking, I suggested a method which simulated
tectonics; a couple of other people said forget all that--just draw some
shapes on a piece of paper.  This suggests the much larger question of how
important it is for a world to have a basis on natural laws.
    At one extreme, you have an Alice's Wonderland where anything is
possible and depends only on the GM's whim ("Wha'd'ya mean 'how does it
work'?  It's _magic_!").  At the other extreme, everything follows from
known laws ("Well then, how does magic work?").
    Most people I've talked with think that the Wonderland extreme is too
arbitrary for playing in for any length of time.  But then the question is
how far to go in the other direction.  Personally, I prefer to go about as
far as humanly possible, for a number of reasons.
    In the long run, it's easier to create a world from basic principles.
After I got my continents mapped out, I didn't have to decide where the
best mining areas were, or who were the major seafaring races, or where the
trade routes for the spice trade go--they were all decided for me by the
geography.  Once you have a firm foundation, it's easy to build other
features on top of it.
    Once you have enough features in place, others will suggest themselves
to you.  When we started writing our magic system, for example, we had no
idea that we would also write the "Mages' Compact" to describe mana use
customs; it was a natural consequence of the system.
    Resolving ambiguities in the rules becomes much easier.  For instance,
will the spell "understand languages" help with a species that communicates
with pheromones?  To answer a question like this, you first have to
understand how the spell works.
    Perhaps the most important reason for having a rational basis for
everything is that it makes the world more realistic.  Your geography
becomes more realistic if your deserts are in fact in the rain shadows of
tall mountains.  Your magic items become more realistic if you can give the
exact words and gestures of the spells used to create them.  Even your gods
become more realistic if you have some creation and other myths telling how
they interact.  All this, in turn, lets the players feel that the characters
they are running are living in a real world, not just in a rule system.
    Finally, there's the purely aesthetic enjoyment of seeing all the
pieces of the world fit together.  I don't think I can put this into words,
and this factor may not even apply for other people.  For me, however, it's
one of the major reasons I am building a world.

Yes, I'll post a summary every week or so - more if there's a lot of
traffic, less if there isn't much traffic.

What's the good word on a climatology simulator?  Still digging
through references, I bet.
