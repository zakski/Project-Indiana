That's what I'm looking into now.  On that reference list I mailed are a LOT
of good references.

(as well as the basic chemistry question in formation) are all relevant, and
I have them (about 2.5 inches or so)  Also was meterologist for navy for a
year.  Also BS in oceanography.  Also bunch of text & reference books.

I'll beat this part till it complies, I hope!

Now THIS becomes more interesting.  I have 19 references in the list, 
But it really isn't as graceful as one would want.....  I am hoping the frp
members can help on this one.  You, for instance.  Aside from some simple
locational analysis I did, I really haven't done much peaceful applications.

(Masters in OR/SA - advanced modelling at Navy Postgraduate School, so did
a good bit of unpeaceful modelling....)

Yeah, but history is useful for verifying model.  That's how checked those
locational analysis models did as an undergrad.

You follow that psychohistory discussion on the net before?  I am the one
that prompted it, and saved every item I could find.  Still have 'em on
disk.  Interested?

Thanks, all parts made it.

	A preliminary scan of the articles answers my question about
whether fractals have been discussed.  As a side note, a course is
being offered at this university (University of Vermont) on the
"Fractal Geography of Nature", a senior/ graduate course offered 
through the geography department.  Although I am unable to take it
(scheduling conflicts, don't you know), I have talked to the professor
and he is VERY interested in this project.  I'll give him a copy
of what's been discussed and post any feedback he might have.
	I will also be posting shortly a list of books and articles,
(after reading all the messages), on fractal simulation of clouds,
rivers, continents, etc.

Some people have been talking about computer-generated solar systems
and planets, so I thought I should try to show the output of a program
I wrote (and still work on, from time to time).  The program is based
on one written by Martyn Fogg and described by him in the Journal of
the British Interplanetary Society (vol 38, p.501).  He, in turn,
based the planetary accretion algorithm on a RAND paper (P-4226)
written by S. Dole in 1969.  I dug through all of the references given
by Fogg and reproduced his program (with some changes).  Although the
iterative process used to generate the planetary mass distribution is
time-consuming, the results it produces is pretty believable.

The program is written in Turbo Pascal, but it should be easy to run
it through a pascal->C translator and come up with runable C code.  If
anyone is interested in this, where should I post or send the code?

I'm including all of the output from the run even though it's pretty
long, so enjoy.

-Another method I've seen used very effectively is the use
-of a sort of fractal algorithm.

This was used at UCSC to create an Empire world map.  You wind up getting
a LOT of islands this way.  If you're looking for a water-world, than this
would be a really good method.

Of course, it may just have been the algorithm he used.  Your milage may
vary.  

And, so I don't get bombarded with mail (he's going to hate me) the person
who did this was koreth@ssyx.ucscc.edu.  Mail him with questions.

	A lot of stuff has been posted on this subject, some of it really neat,
 like tracing a continent and mirror imaging it with a slight rotation of polar
coordinates, *but* I think that the EASIEST way to do a map, is merely to get a
piece of your favourite paper (mine's hex or plain) and a pencil and draw.
	If you've seen a few maps, then you can make yours look appropriatly
realistic.  There need be no logic behind the placement of continents, like
plate techtonics, thats just TOO complicated.  Players don't really care why a
terrain feature exists in a certain place, it just does.
	Admittedly its hard to justify a desert right next to a tropical
rain forrest, but thats where common sense enters the picture.

	My opinion is that a computer simulator would be nice, but a complete
waste of time.

    There is a complete discussion of the algorithm recently given in this
group on how create realistic maps in a new book, _The Sceince of Fractal
Images_ edited by Peitgen and Saupe.  They discuss the problem with the 
ridges in the orginal algotithms and methods to avoid this problem.

    This is a wonderful book with lots of pretty pictures and easly understood
algorithms.  This cost is high though at $34 to $35.  Encourage your local
library to get a copy or two.

    Even with the fixes for the 'ridge problem' this algorithm is still not
perfect.  In the same book is a discussion about rivers and watersheads.
There is some preliminary thoughts on how to handle rivers and watersheads.

     Maybe someday I will find the time to code up this algotithm to generate
a world terrian.  It would be great for space games where lots of worlds may
needs to generated.  The approach that I am considering would to be to start
with a isocosahedron (is that spelled correctly?), i.e. the shape of a 20
sided die, and subdivide each triangle into smaller triangles until I reach
the resolution that I want.  This is like the orginal method given except
it is based on a trianglar grid instead of a square one.  This way I can
come up with a complete planet and even generate views of it from space,
adding clouds is a different problem.

I have actually done this, although the algorithm used was based on the one
given by Fournier/Fussell/Carpenter in "Computer Rendering of Stochastic
Models", _Comm._of_the_ACM_, Vol. 25 No. 6 (June 1982).  Also, I recommend
starting from a much better approximation of a sphere than an icosohedron.

Basically, what we did was:

Plot latitude/longitude lines for an actual sphere, and use the intersect
points as the corners of triangles.  Where the lat/long lines form a
rectangle, divide along one diagonal to make two triangles.

Subdivide each triangle into four new triangles, as shown:
	 /\          /\
	/  \        /__\    The triangles don't need to be equilateral,
       /    \      /\  /\   they're shown that way for ease of drawing.
      /______\    /__\/__\
Move the corners of the center triangle in random directions, mostly
toward/away from the center of the sphere, but allowing a little side-to-
side shift as well.  The more radical the side-to-side shift, the less
obvious the original grid lines will be; but be careful -- the shifts
(including up/down shifts) must be proportional to the size of the
triangle.  Don't "fold" the triangles over one another by shifting too
far.  Remember that moving the corners of the center triangle also moves
two corners of each of the other triangles -- the corners that are
"shared" with the center triangle.

Recur on each of the new triangles, until the resulting triangles are
"sufficiently small", which is dependent on how close you want to be
able to "zoom in" on your globe.

When we plotted the resulting pictures, with shading but without taking
into account "sea level", so the whole surface was visible, it looked
very much like a ball of crumpled tin foil.  Now I'm curious how much
like a planet it would have looked if we had colored everything inside
a certain radius blue.  If anyone tries this, let me know if you like
what you get.

How to make a map for a FRPG:

1.  Take a piece of paper and draw something that looks a little like
    a continent, making the lines rather squiggly and throwing in a
    few islands.

2.  Draw in places where mountains and forests and plains and deserts
    and lakes should go by just choosing a place and sticking something
    in there.

3.  Throw in some cities and maybe some national boundries.

4.  Forget all that stuff about plate tetonics and meteorology.

I'm interested in how you tweak these algorithms.  I presume you mean
fractal techniques when you talk about algorithms that are widely available.
Can you post some of your code, or descriptions of what you did?  Anything
would be appreciated.

I like this.  Since I am basically a computer illiterate, I follow the
path of least resistence when making a map.  I just grab a pencil and
paper and start drawing.  Unfortunately, it does not always work.
When I enlarged my 8 1/2 x 11 map of my main continent by a factor of
three (by hand and an architect scale), it really looked like
someone had tried to cram as much landmass as possible on a piece of
paper (which, of course, was the case!).  Thus, I am planning a major
remodel [got to kick my instinctive conservationist attitude, I guess
:-)]
 
:I prefer my method of taking an existing USGS map and sinking it.  
 
:All that you really need to worry about is weather.  

I once went to the library and used the USGS maps to expand the
Pacific Northwest to ten times scale.  I simply used the real climate
of the region as a guide; I had to adjust a bit inland for
"continentality".  I like huge worlds because I always have a place to
put something, no matter how large.  Of course, I have to fudge a bit
on things like gravity and storm formation, but it's just a game,
right?
