A couple of people have expressed interest in getting the algorithms together
for creating a universe - from the selection/generation of stars down to
stellar systems, planets, surfaces, climatology, biospheres, and sociology.

Interest/advice?

Hey, I'm really interested in doing this.  Could you give me a little
more detail?  I've done some reading on plate tectonics but I could never
quite figure out how to make this work.  I'd like to write a computer
program that generates real-looking worlds using this technique.  The
main thing that interests me is applying the technique to planets that
are not like Earth - larger, smaller, different % water, etc.

I can handle dividing the globe up into plates.  Can you really just assign
random directions and speeds?  It gets really messy to keep track of
when things keep crawling over the poles, etc.

Glad to hear that you are interested in Actual.  I am too.
Please read Marks's article again.  Mark did not write that, he
posted it for me.  I have read-only news access at the moment.

There are really three separate simulations involved here:  
1)  Simulate the development of planetary systems and stars
2)  Simulate the growth of a single intelligent race
3)  Simulate the interaction of starfaring races with other races

A lot of scientists have studied (1), notably Stephen Dole (_Habitable
Planets for Man_), M.H.Hart (several papers on atmospheric and
climatic evolution), and so on.  There are also a number of SF
roleplaying games, eg _Traveller_, _Other Suns_ or _GURPS Space_ that
take a die-rolling approach to (1).  

I feel that the astrophysically "correct" simulations take too long when
you want to generate a couple hundred systems.  On the other hand, the
die-rolling star system generators are biased towards generating
human-habitable planets and don't feel as "real" to me.  The work I
have done, I admit, uses a die-rolling approach.  I have written
some kind of program that generates star sectors, much like programs
people have written for Trav.

To my knowledge, nobody has studied (2) in the literature.  SFRPGs
all have some method of generating alien races but they don't give
you any feel for how the race developed.  I am working on a journal
paper describing a simulator for cultural development.

There are a huge number of examples of (3); almost every SF book has 
one.  OK, not _almost every_, but there are a lot.  Almost every SF
book I read has one.  The trick is that every example is generated
by hand.  Some author sits down for a couple of hours / days / years
and thinks out an interesting wrinkle nobody else has used.

I'm pretty sure nobody has ever tried to do a simulation of (3).  If
we do, one use for it will be to watch it until it generates a 
really interesting universe, and then write a story set in that
universe.  I have a program that handles contact between starfaring
races in a really simple way, only about five different interactions
(peace, war, one conquers the other, one teaches the other, one
destroys the other).  I stopped working on it because I needed
a lot more detail on (2) before I could go much further.

So, what kinds of things have you worked on?  If we have a common
interest maybe we can share our ideas on problems we've run into.
Maybe we can take some ideas and program them independently, to
get two different approaches.

Hope to hear from you soon!

Jim,
I'm interested in getting some references from you, or maybe just details
of how you made things work.  I'm not in the astrophysics field (instead,
computer design) so I don't know a lot of the basic equations.

> I lifted a condensate version of planetary creation to derive size and

Is this the ACCRETE simulator that a lot of people use?  I forget who
developed it - S. Dole, I think.  What information do you get re core/crust
composition?  Does it take into account the metallicity of the dust
(ie Pop II stars have low metal content)
 
> I used star temp and the distance/mass of the planet to get probable
> atmosphere composition & pressure (ev calculations, liquid water temp
> range, dust, that type of stuff)
Does this sort of computation give you Venus?  Hart has done a lot of work
on an outgassing simulator that models the chemistry of interchanges
between ocean, rocks, life and atmosphere.  I have a version I got from
a friend that runs on an IBM PC in Basic.  What did you do with Dust?

> I performed a few fits to the only system I knew to get random generators
> for stuff like moons & rings.  Did use roch stuff for breakups.
OK, here's a question.  What kinds of ranges of results did you get?
I can not figure out why Jupiter has moons and Saturn has rings.
Also, I can't figure out why Mars has a couple of rocks in orbit while
Earth has Luna.  My best guess is that Luna is captured, as is
Nereid of Neptune.

I tried out this theory by modifying ACCRETE so that when planetesimals
orbital ranges overlap one can capture the other.  The original says
that they always collide.  This gave me good results, actually; the
only problem is that I couldn't simulate the orbital interactions of
the captured moon with other moons.  For example, I think Neptune has
only one other moon, in a really eccentric orbit.  My theory says that
when Nereid was captured Neptune had a moon system like Jupiter's, but
Nereid disrupted their orbits and they collided with Neptune or
Nereid.

I'm afraid I didn't understand this.  I've played with fractal landscapes.

The only climatology stuff I've seen is some papers in _Icarus_
describing systems of differential equations taking _days_ of computer
time to solve.  I'd really like to see something that could take
distance from sun, length of year, length of day and axial tilt, and
give you things like prevailing wind and climate patterns.  Can you
give me any pointers?

I have three or four IBM PC Basic programs lying around which I could
us-mail you if you're interested:
1)   ACCRETE, the planetary accretion simulator, from Dole
1a)  A modification of (1) to allow captured moons, by me
1b)  Another modification of (1) which uses the same accretion engine

     and Mars, also by me
2)   Hart's atmosphere simulator

You know that "integrate over random hemisphere" for elevation?  The same
trick, but use biased distributions on first pass for other characteristics
(like mineral deposites, to yank one out of the air)

(was meterologist for USNR for a while)
You can get climatology from the parameters you gave, but you have to throw in
things like distance from ocean (for habitable) in direction of prevailing
winds (planet-wide hadley cells for prevailing zones).  For microclimates
("local weather") you sorta gotta cheat (statistical separation from 
predicted climate)  I think I have an article that has a basic program that
dies the planetwide climate from orbital characteristics someplace.  Or 
maybe the other way (climate to orbit).

REf 3 (interaction between races).  I'll have to dig.  I don't think I even
marked that down, so I'll have to rethink it.

Maybe an article in one of the travellers or such will spin out.

(I had the most fun looking at exchanges between storage & computation
that would allow the re-derivation of the same physical characteristics
for the same place so I wouldn't have to calculate every meter of the
blasted planet IN ADVANCE then store the entire thing, so I could
revisit a site many times without finding it had changed.  Fun.
My masters in OR/SA specialized in advanced modelling, so that is the
way I went)

Good place to start is college (early) geology books, chapter on climatology.
Got a selection of stuff like "tide prediction" and such from meterology at
home.  Bet most of the "Weather prediction" stuff will "run backwards"
(a common trick I use) fairly well.
I'll see what I can find....

Jim,

This morning I us-mailed to you an envelope containing:

1) a listing and sample run of an atmosphere generator based on the
work of M.H.Hart.  The program isn't commented, but I attached the
first page of the paper it's based on ... I'd suggest you get a copy of
the whole paper.  If you can't find it, let me know and I'll xerox you
one.

2) a listing and sample run of the ACCRETE condensation simulator which I
modified to allow captured moons and resonances.  I mentioned that the
original forced collisions between overlapping planetesimals; I modified
it to allow either captures (of Luna by Earth) or resonances, such as might
explain the orbital overlap of Pluto and Neptune in addition to collisions.

3) a listing and sample run of the scaled-down condensation simulator 
which does a pretty good job on moons, although I never learned enough
about Roche's law to put in rings for moons that are too close.

I also got the cc of your msg re GMs Guide to Star Construction.

On other fronts, a guy in rec.games.frp made a passing reference to
a tectonic simulation - continental drift, mountains, archipelagoes, etc.
I think it was just a way to do it by hand, but I'm trying to get some

Hope to hear from you soon re climate generation & etc.

A question to all of you who have designed your own worlds:

What techniques do people use for map-making?  Do you have detailed maps
with terrain types, vegetation, and contour lines, or do you use simplistic
maps with the locations of towns, villages, and roads only?

I've been GM'ing since 1981 (the first four years with AD&D, more recently
with Fantasy Hero) and have designed a world which I am rather proud of.
However, I have never been very fond of the maps I made.  And so, in
preparation for a new campaign I am contemplating, I decided to upgrade
my maps.  My main inspiration has been the Harn and Ivinia packages from
Columbia Games.  These regional modules are incredibly detailed, highly
consistent, and the maps are *beautiful*.  I would love to have that
amount of detail to my world, but have no idea where to begin!

And so, the question is put to all of you:  How to design a world.
I'm not interested in the magic as much as I am with the society and
the geography.

A great method I was taught at GenCon:
Take a map of the U.S., preferably one that can be marked on without anyone
getting upset (you can get one from your local branch of the US Geological
Survey).  Once you know how much land area you want your map to cover, isolate
that much of the U.S.  (This example is of the U.S., but any map will do.
Any scale, even.)  Pick out all of the contour lines of a given elevation,
say the 500 line for a full-scale map of the U.S.  Sink everything beneath
that by inking it over with blue.  What's left looks nothing like the U.S.,
and maybe two hours were spent making it.

Hope this helps.

Well, my first campaign that I did detailed maps for was an Island-based
campaign.  I had a couple larger continents and a lot of small islands.
I started with a fairly sparse maps with just coastlines and capitals
and a few mountains, drawn in fat felt-tip markers.  I wasn't very
satified with that so I next traced the features onto a new hex sheet,
and redrew it with micro-ball pens.  Here I put forests, mountains, roads,
cities, etc.  This map had a scale of about 50 miles to the hex.

I then made blow-up maps of the major island where the campaign mainly 
took place.  This pair of maps was about 12 miles/hex in scale, and showed
the major castles, all towns over about 1000, all roads, swamps, major
fief boundaries, mountains with contour lines, rivers, forests, etc.

I also started a set of 3 mile/hex maps, but never finished them.  The ones
I did finish were around the major cities.  These showed everything: bridges,
all manor houses, shell keeps, villages over about 100, minor fief boundaries, 
minor roads (trails), small woods, small lakes, etc.  

The method I use for map-making is as follows: just start drawing coastline
having some idea of whether you want a bunch of islands, a few small continents,
or one large continent.  Make sure you squiggle enough to make it look like
coastline.  Perhaps practice on a blank paper for a bit to get the effect
you want.  

Once the coastline is drawn, I next draw the mountains;  if you just draw
the limit of each range and then put a dot where each peak is, you can
fill in the contours later.  The mountains are usually in the center of
the continents, with some others elsewhere.  These define the high spots
of the continent.

Next come the lakes; these define the local low-spots of the continent.
There can be lakes near mountains as long as there is some reason why
they haven't flowed away.  Next comes rivers.  They usually start in
the mountains and flow toward the lakes and coastlines.  Here again,
a steady hand is not necessarily an asset: rivers tend to meander a bit.

Before drawing the forests, I decide on how densely populated the various
areas are going to be and situate the cities.  This is because in heavily
populated areas, the forests will have been cut for farmland.
Cities of any size are almost always located near oceans or large rivers,
since water travel is essential to early trade.  If on the ocean, they
tend to be near somewhat protected bays or better yet, where rivers
join the ocean.

Now I place the forests, based on the cities and density.  Unless the
area is not naturally forested (plains, for instance), everything that
isn't heavily settled is forest.

I also add a few swamps, too, near rivers, perhaps one end of a lake,
or near the ocean (brine marsh).  Don't go overboard on swamps unless
this is a very wet climate.

Now, all this is assuming temperate climate zones.  I usually don't
include deserts, artic regions, etc. (at least I don't usually map them).

After all this, I work on the cultures and societies.  I'll leave
that for another posting.

> What techniques do people use for map-making?

    How much effort are you willing to put into it?  The more effort, the
better the results.  Anyway, here are the steps I took.

1)  Take a course in geography, or read a textbook, to learn plate tectonics.

2)  Randomly divide your globe into 20 or so tectonic plates of various
sizes.  Make about 1/4 of them continental plates and the rest ocean.
Add half a dozen hot spots for flavor.

3)  Give your plates random directions and velocities and let 'em rip.
Keep track of the mountain ranges, trenches, archipelagos, etc. which are
formed in the process.

4)  After 100,000,000 year's worth of movement (or so), modify the directions
and velocities and move the plates around some more.  Remember to erode the
mountains which were made previously.  Repeat this process five or six times
until you get a world you like.

5)  Learn meteorology (or find someone who already knows it) and map out the
weather patterns of your world.  Start by putting in ocean currents and trade
winds, then put in dry areas at latitudes 30 degrees north and south (or was
it 15 degrees?  I took the path of finding someone who already knows about
it).  Figure out rain shadows, drainage patterns, and influences of hot and
cold ocean currents.  From temperature and rainfall, determine vegetation.

6)  Put major cities at the mouths of river, guarding strategic straits, and
anywhere else you think you need a major city.  Try to figure out from the
environmental conditions what the major industries in an area are.  This is
tricky, and can probably be best done by comparison with analagous areas on
Earth.

7)  I don't know the best way to determine political boundaries.  Certainly
seas, mountains, and major deserts should divide countries.  Perhaps you could
just add unorganized communities to your world and let them fight it out for
themselves.

    If you get ambitious, you can add things like races, language families,
local superstitions, etc.  This sounds like a lot of work, and it is, but in
my opinion it is worth it not only for the detailed and realistic world you
get, but also for what you learn about our own world in the process.
