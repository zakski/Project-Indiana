Thanks for replying.  Yes, I would appreciate an archive of what has already
been discussed;  I missed most of the recent postings.
	Excuse me if this has already been beat to death, but has anyone 
in this discussion considered using fractals to generate terrain.
The basic idea is to circle a sphere using random faults (10000 faults works
rather nicely).  I've heard rumors that STARFLIGHT generates its planetary
surfaces using this method (I've only seen the game, I don't actually have it)
Of course, the disadvantage is the incredible amount of cpu time that this 
requires.  This could be offset at the cost of flexibility by building a
database of planetary surfaces.
	Just throwing out some ideas.  If you have any suggestions for
improvement, please don't hesitate to flame away.

				Ralph

How about everyone give some relevant experience, references, observations,

Included is a copy of my fractal program.  All it does it
to take a flat grid.  Pick two points on that grid,
draw a line between them.  THen pick a side of the line.
Everythign on one side moves up, everything on the other
moves down.  Repeat.  Then it prints themap out using some
pretty arbitrary ranges I've set up for how high things
are relative to each other.

To use it you will need three routines which for ease of
transmission I haven't included.  They are
cls() [clear the screen].
cursor(x,y) position the cursor at (x,y) on the screen
rnd(a,b) [return a random integer between a and b inclusive]

(pretty trivial stuff).

Thanks,

Here are my interests.  I'm afraid they're only tangentially related
to the aims of this mailing list....

Suppose that one has a landscape, either generated by simulation
or drawn by hand.  What are the possible patterns of climate and
weather?  Where will deserts, rain forests, plains naturally fall?
How is this affected by latitude and other temperature considerations?

Suppose that one has people on this landscape.  What are the patterns
of population density to be expected?  That is, if there are x people
in a useable land area of y, how large will the largest cities likely
be?  The average towns?  How many people is too many for a given mode
of life?

At what size do small local units start aggregating into larger ones?
I have "nations" in my campaign world where loose aggregates of city-states
might be more reasonable, given low population densities.

I'm not interested in simulating history as such.  For me, all the interest
and use in history lies in the unique, unexpected human quirks.  Mass
trends predicatable by psychohistory are background at best.

[much of Mary Kuhner's letter para-phrased to save space]

[ general trends for weather (with deserts and forests being examples) ]

Mountains, when coupled with winds can create some interesting weather
patterns.  The leeward side of the mountain range will tend to be drier
than the windward side.  Very high mountain ranges can border your
deserts very nicely.  The windward side, being rained on quite frequently,
can either become a jungle (tropical rain forest), a deciduous (sp?) forest
(temperate weather), a coniferous forest (temperate to arctic), or a snowy
waste (arctic).

Also note that deserts may be found on the coast.  If you postulate that
the level of the seas on your planet have dropped very slowly, great
deposits of salt can be left along the coast.  Such salt deposits tend
to ruin the land for life (although some animals might venture there
occasionally to supplement the salt in their diet).  Plant life will be
very scarce, and will tend toward those forms that are carnivorous
(giant honeydews, venus fly traps, et al).

[ possible expectations for population density ]

Hunter-gatherers will tend to take up very large ranges.  Villages of
not more than a score of people will tend to be the norm, with each village
being one family unit.  Families will tend to be greatly extended, with all
males of a child's father's generation being called father.  Polygynany will
tend to also be the norm, with females being sold, traded, or given, to
other males to extend the family.

Agricultural societies will tend to be more numerous, although primitive
agriculturalists will not be too much more numerous than hunter-gatherers.
Big-men will begin to appear as rulers.  Big-men are more middle men for
moving goods around than true rulers, but they do hold some power.  The
primary crops will be on the order of yams, and other quickly perishable
foods.

As agriculture progresses, the big-men will be replaced by chiefs.  Chiefs
will act as store-houses of grain (grain being more rot resistant than
yams).  The chiefs will also act as war leaders, although they may have to
bow at times to the wishes of the tribal medicine man.

[ when will nations begin to appear ]

Nations begin to form when the use of land becomes a priviledge rather than
a right.  A chief might become so powerful that he can order his people to
leave certain portions of land to him, or to work those lands purely for his
own gain.  At such a time, the chief will have become a ruler of a nation.
An army will very likely follow, so as to be able to protect the chief's 
properties.  These armies will be paid from the store that the chief has
accumulated, or is accumulating.

City-states should be the first step to forming a nation, with larger nations
developing as the rulers of city-states expand their influence by might of arms.
The ruler of each city-state will be very proud of his/her accomplishment, and
will be almost certainly contemptuous of his peers (some craftier rulers will
play the innocent, openly admiring the accomplishment of another while plotting
the overthrow of his "hero").


With magic added in, anything is possible, but civilization will tend to grow
in places where agriculture is dominant, with hunting reduced to a secondary
role.  Frontier lands, and borders where wars are common will tend to revert
to hunting-gathering, or will rely on more secure locations for provisions.

Should an area be found to be rich in a commodity, whether that commodity be
wood, gold, silver, iron, coal, or whatever, somebody will move there to
exploit the abundance.  This does not necessarily mean that great cities will
just suddenly pop up, but the seeds will be planted.  And if you should happen
to have a river or two meet, one from an iron-rich province, and one from
a coal-rich region ...

Consider that humans tend to congregate either where easy transport is
available (river mouths, river confluences, either side of a mountain
pass, harbors, road intersections, etc...), or where raw resources are
available (good farm land [low pop density, but you'll have a town for
trading and staples for every X many acres], mines [which leads to ghost
towns too], good fishing [generally from a safe harbor area], etc..)

I know it's not much on numbers, but it'll point you in the general
direction....

> At what size do small local units start aggregating into larger ones?

With agrarian societies, the small farm will be part of a loose agregate
of farms which all center on a town which is no more than 1/4 of a day away
by whatever is the normal mode of transportation.  You need 1/4th of a day
to travel to the town for market, 1/2 of a day for market, and 1/4th to travel
home.  So, the size of your basic 'agregate' depends on the level of
technology available.

If your only transport for the average joe is his feet, then the largest
'basic agregate' will be no more than 6 miles radius.  Give him a horse,
and you get maybe 12 miles.  A team with wagon, you get maybe 20 miles,
more if it's possible to 'lay-over' at the destination.  A car with good
roads? Maybe 100 miles radius.

Larger agregates depend heavily on terain.  A flat plain surrounded by
mountains will probably be under one 'overlord'.  (Call him whatever you
want, he's the leader...)  Mountainous terrain will probably have more,
smaller, units centered on valleys. etc....  Eventually, you reach the
continent size.  The largest independent unit again depends on technology.

If the best you have is feet.  The largest 'nation' will probably be no
more than 100 miles radius, and basically linked by a common language.
If you have modern tech, then you can probably cover a continent.

I think I would recommend the PBS series "The Day the Universe Changed".
It should give you a good feeling for how individual human quirks can have
a profound impact on the course of humanity at large.

Well, here's what I've learned or have been able to figure out from just
camping out:
	1)	Clouds tend to form over bodies of water and large
	concentrations of vegetation.
	2)	Winds tend to blow from oceans to the land during the
	day, and from land to the oceans at night (I do know the
	scientific reason for this if anyone wants it).
	3)	High mountains tend to cause clouds to pile up against
	them, letting them all over as one big, dense cloud, instead of
	the scattered clouds they would have been.  When they get on the
	other side of the mountains, they tend to drop their load of rain,
	causing flooding (if enough clouds piled up).
	4)	Deserts expand over time.  The expansion progresses in
	all directions, but quickest in the direction that the wind in
	that area is most likely to blow.
	5)	Over a particular piece of land, there will usually be
	two layers of wind, each blowing in different directions.  The upper
	layer will always be faster.  On Earth, the lower layer of wind
	spirals clockwise out of high pressure zones, and counter-clockwise
	into low pressure zones in the Northern hemisphere, and vice versa
	in the Southern hemisphere (I may have this backwards).  The air
	flowing into low pressure zones travels higher, cooling and forming
	clouds, and then away from the low pressure zone, forming the upper
	layer of wind.  In High pressure zones, the wind leaving is actually
	wind from the upper layer which has  descended and reversed course.
	6)	Valleys can trap, redirect, and strengthen winds that blow
	up their lengths.  One example of this is the infamous Santa Ana
	winds of Southern California autumns.  Around mid-September, winds
	in Mexico blow northward over the deserts East of San Diego, and 
	around Palm Springs, warming up as they go.  The then travel 
	through the Imperial Valley (?) which funnels the wind into the
	LA basin.  Viola!  Hot, fast winds...   This can happen anywhere
	you have the geography for it.

Well.   That's about it...

Subject: Factors affecting coastlines (re: simulator)
Status: RO


    One factor which affects the shape of the land (but which I don't know
a whole lot about myself) is coral.  Any good geology reference should be
able to tell you how coral atolls form around islands as the sea level
gradually rises.  I don't know coral affects continental coastlines, but I
seem to remember that it does to a fairly large extent.

    You will probably also want to look into barrier islands--those long thin
islands parallel to the shore such as you see off the coast of the Carolinas.
Unfortunately, I don't remember how these are formed.  I think it's time for
me to start studying geology again....

    Relatively small features such as these probably don't need to be added
to the tectonic simulation itself.  It's probably enough to wait until the
continents are in place and then put them in where the conditions are right
for them.  Of course, it all depends on how detailed a simulation you want.

This is not a flame of the technique.
Rather, it is an opinion, mixed with a bit of advice for beginning DM's.

You don't _really_ need to watch a computer spin the globe a few times
to come up with a viable map.  Simply sketch out what *you* want to see
on the map; it doesn't have to in scale or that accurate, if you don't
want it to.  In-scale maps are only really good for long-distance travel,
and you can just guesstimate these times, anyway.

I prefer my method of taking an existing USGS map and sinking it.  Very
realistic, easily something plate tectonics could come up with (after all,
it did).  Most players won't realize what's going on, especially with the
abysmal knowledge of geography most people have today.

If you _do_ add something, and a player says "that doesn't make sense!", you
can always say "the dwarves did it" or "well, that's what happens when a
mage creates a volcano", or something.

All that you really need to worry about is weather.  The absolute best
preparation for this is a basic course in geography, but if necessary,
you can plug your world into a computer program.  Random charts are
OK, _if_ they make sense; don't have a blizzard one day and a heat wave
the next.
