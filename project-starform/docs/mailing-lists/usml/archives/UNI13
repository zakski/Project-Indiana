Since you were asking for backgrounds and interests, here's mine:

I'm a software engineer interested in Fantasy Role-playing games.  Although
most of the areas discussed so far are of interest, my reason for joining
the mailing list is to discover more about climate generation.  (My world
already has a map and it's local space is not important)  I will be
taking a class this fall on weather and climate, so in the future I may be
able to contribute something.

Something that would be useful to me, although I can't imagine how it could be
done, would be a history generator.  It seems most fantasy worlds have thousands
of years history behind them.  That is a lot of time to account for by hand!
(Science fiction worlds tend to have short histories:  Planet colonized in
year x, resources heavily exploted since then, rebels now trying to take over.
1/2 ;-) )  Perhaps a standard random event generator could be used, but
something tells me that the events wouldn't "hang together" as well as "real
history" does.  Any suggestions, ideas?

Finally, what exactly is "geopolitics"?  The generation of policical boundaries
based on geography?

Subject: My interests and background
Status: RO

  My background is computer science.  A couple of years ago, I spent a lot of
time skimming a wide a variety of books related to hand-crafts and technologies
up through the Middle Ages.  I took notes and have collated many of them
to generate rules-of-thumb for such things as crop yields, livestock sizes,
food & pasture needs, and butchered-weight, vehicle & pack animal abilities,
prices (in terms of bushels of barley), population densities, ...  I also
have several books discussing the interrelationships between animal sizes,
locomotive speeds, capacity for metabolic work, life-span, ....  None of this
information is on line, but I would be willing to type in some of it from time 
to time.

  I am interested in learning terrain generating techniques, the abilities
of lifeforms under various atmospheric and gravity conditions, how to pick
plausible climates under assorted world-parameters, and guidelines for picking
internally-consistent (plausible) societies.

    My main interests in this list are tectonics, climatology, biological
development, and geopolitics.  I have been running and playing an AD&D-type
game for about a decade, and I would like to get one well-mapped world to
run in.
    My background is computer programming, mainly 2-D graphics.  However,
I've always been interested in pretty much all sciences, with entomology
topping the list.

Status: RO

I joined this mailing list to gain concepts and techniques for planetary
development, partly for intellectual stimulation and partly for use in
fantasy and scifi role playing games.  I am most interested in map making,
determination of weather patterns in generated continents, and the effects
of geography and climate on cultures at various levels of technology.

I don't think I bring much to the party except for a scifi fan world view
and computer sophistry, which I think all members of the mailing list share.
I can't keep up with some of the fancy tech talk on fractals and
climatology, but I am interested anyway.

I'm a programmer for the University of Michigan with a sweet
tooth for games of various natures. Like a large number of
respondees have said so far, I have simulated any universes
lately, but I am very interested. What I do know about, is
distributed computing, gaming theory, and AI. I'm not sure how
to go about computing the characteristics of a third generation
star, but if someone is, I can program it and make it work in
a network of computers. Also, the life developement interests
me, but so far I've not seen anything about extra-human
developement. To wit, we haven't seen anything that might
describe a non-omnivore/herbivore intelligence.

I've joined this mailing list primarily because I am interested in the idea
of a computer-created gaming universe where the computer could assume the place
of DM, possibly meshing pre-created scenes together to form a region.  To this
end, I'd like to see information on creating a world (including the discussed
tectonics, climatic modeling, and city growth and spread), populating a world
(this is on the more fantastic end -- potential alien races, stages of civion, interaction between starfaring worlds and between empires on a single
world, etc), and universe-to-game conversions (i.e. the average player may
not have access to the volume of information printed out from the "system"
program, or such access may not be desirable -- so the computer might tell
him clues and such generated by the system information, such as "You have entered a system governed by a single brilliant blue-white giant.  Your sensors
indicate the presence of six planets orbiting the star system...").

I can't bring too much to this group because I am still relatively uneducated
compared to doctorates and professionls -- I am a sophomore at U.C. Berkeley
and plan to enter Computer Science as a major.  I've read a lot of science
fiction and played a lot of computer games (I have little experience with RPGs
in face-to-face play, however)...

My primary goal is to develop a simulated world that a person/player can
walk through and SEE. the person should not be constrained to walk only in
the direction the game designer had planned, following a narrow well defined
path through a nebulous world.

To achieve this you need to be able to generate topography and plant life.
>From topography comes a need for (probably) tectonics, weather patterns,
erosion and probably more. Plant life requires climate, soil conditions,
insect life. Climate & erosion depend on plant life. You probably could
make a really twisted dependency graph out of just the first two dozen
factors...

Since I'd like to get something running in my current incarnation, I'm
probably interested in focusing on the basic geography & climate. Let's
say aiming for for a program which will provide topographical maps,
(including placing bodies of water), temperature & rainfall information.

If we have someone around with an interest in Grand Designs, an overall 
structure for all of the various pieces that people are interested in building
might be very useful. The general idea being that a topography and
climate system could be designed to accept as input certain parameters from 
a solar system gereration routine, and pass on its information as output
to somone interested in plant life (Several steps down the pipe come
sociology and civilization - that's the HARD stuff.)

My background is in computer science, science fiction and role-playing 
games. I'd like to find a way to combine the three...
