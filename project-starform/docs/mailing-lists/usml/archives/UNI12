My own work lies in the fractal area, but I have been unhappy with it.  I had not thought
of the plate tectonics idea, and I find that most exciting - especially since it also
helps with climate and the like, which fractals do not.  I intend to work on that, when
I get some spare time (early next year, maybe).

Other interests of mine include non-normal worlds.  Tectonics would be great for planetary
terrain in SF, but it is limiting in Fantasy.  Think of Diskworld from Pratchett's
"The Light Fantastic", for example.  One of my fantasy worlds (in a manual game) was a vast
plain that stretched for infinity in every direction.  It had no plate tectonics, and
was essentially static, although similar in detail to a "normal" landscape (this universe
was based on certain medieval concepts of Earth, "logicalized" into a playable gamescape.
Its internal logic permitted such flights of fantasy as flying up to the sun (which was a
ball of fire a few hundred feet in diameter) and examining it - even at night when it was
"out"!)

For these, fractals offer the only real hope, I think, though I am unhappy with most of the
algorithms I have.  Generating the surface (and seas) is relatively easy - translating THAT
into stands of trees, plains, etc. (ie FEATURES of terrain) is not.

How does EMPIRE do it?  I have never seen a listing of that game, but it seems to generate
some plausible-looking maps.

I regret that I have relatively little to contribute to this discussion,
but find the information being shared here to be fascinating.  All of it --
cosmology, planetology, meteorology, topography, sociology (and any other
-ologies I might have left out) -- I find really interesting.  I hope that
you do not mind me leeching off of this information feed....

	As soon as I move my program up to the big machine I'll send
	it over to you. It has some bugs that are being very evasive.
	You'll see them soon after you start playing with it. The
	program is a finite element analyses algorithm. I don't know
	the real differencial equations, but I have a good idea about
	the linearized equations. The time scales are still not very
	realistic, but they are easy to change. The trees live only
	as long as it takes a drop of water to move down a large mountain.
	As for weather I know exactly what needs to be done and how
	to do it, in the frame work of my current program. However
	classes and work restrict the amount of time I can spend working
	on it. Also, I'm getting close to the limits of TP3, I'm very
	close to the 64k limit. I'll have to use overlays. I wanted
	to keep it as close to standard pascal as possible. A quick 
	run down of climate is to lay a grid over the land, the smaller
	the better. At each point on the grid you need to know temp,
	pressure, moisture content of the air and soil type. Soil type
	affects temp, and moisture content. Temp affects pressure.
	The gradient of pressure is wind. wind carries temp and moisture.
	Then check for cloud formation and rain. clouds change surface 
	temp so does rain. This is simplified, but I think you get the
	idea. I got this from reading an elementary book on meteorology.
	the equations are very simple. You need at least 2 layers of air
	for the formation of realistic storms. Thats what I'm going to
	use. I'm going to use the existing code for all of the weather.

I have no degrees as yet, and ot much useful to contribute to this list as yet.
I was albe to answer the one tectonics querie because I watched an unusual 
amount of public television when I was younger and i picked up a lot of mostly-
useless trivia.  I can contribute programming skills, but so can just about
everyone else on the list.  I will soon have a copy of _the scince of fractal
images_ and may be able to contribute new tweaks to the algorithms therein,
but that isn't much of a contribution.  I'ma thrid year math major who hasn't 
taken very much math, although before a year has past I may have taken a class
in fractal geometry that just opened up here at UCSC.  maybe then I'll be of
some help.

[ Actual v6.6, on uVAX II, under Ultrix 2.0 ]



Thank you to all those who sent me the Quasi-Space and CyberTime

libraries.  They are really great!  I sent two PsiBorgs back.  One

got lost, but the other one got an old copy of the List (about six

aeons old).  It wasn't immediately useful, but I did get an idea (I

think) about what might be on it now.



Thanks to jerri@mwvax1 for info on the Planet Compiler.  The trick is

to use a second-generation Hydrogen Cloud (as I did) but also to

fertilize it with a Rogue Comet (which I thought was unnecessary).  A

regular Comet does not add enough rare earth metals.  You can also get

the Rogue Comet to leave some RNA (I won't tell how).  Also, jerri

pointed out that for Type G's, it helps to have at least two ice ages,

(you get that with $(ICE) = 2 in the makefile).  Try it, you'll like it!



witchazel@suncity was very informative as well as providing me with

the newer Politics Editor.  I recommend it very highly.  I got to a

Stage 12 very quickly and it has been stable for about 6 hours now

(seven game centuries).  The keyboard macros make it much easier to

maintain parity between the Scientists and the others.  Only problem

was that when Bartering died out, Travel wasn't yet sufficiently

advanced to allow for Asteroid Belt exploitation so there was one

very messy period there when the Enemy was in every Clique.  I think

I wore out the ^U on my keyboard!



Anyway, I have a coupla more questions:



     1.  Can using ChronStop affect later Interpreter Loops when the

you're in the DemiGod Environment?  I use ChronStop a lot, but it

seems to set a bit somewhere so when I eval any Planet-Recursive

function I can't get any side effects.  Like even output!



     2.  Why doesn't the (my?) Saviour like FTL travel?  Can there

be more than one?  Does each planet have to breed it's own Saviour,

or is there some other way for it to travel?  Can Robotics have

Saviours?  One of mine seems to need it real bad.  Perhaps I should

just wipe it and re'Gram it?  Seems a waste...



     3.  I tried opening the SpaceNet server as a raw device.  Then I

read the Star Matrix directly into the debugger.  Right there in the

hexeditor was a very remarkable pattern!  I can't believe it still

works as a program.  Is this intentional?  If so, I must compliment

the authors on not only an extremely absorbing game system, but also a

genuine work of art.  (You may bow now.  You know who you are.)



Actually yours,

Well, I am a little reluctant to be doing this, because I know what's going

to happen, but...  I'm the author of the Quasi-Space library for Actual.

Sorry about the delay with the new version, but my Laws of Physics module

broke when I added in the Matsuda constant.  Do you have 6.6 of Actual or

6.6 of the QS library?  Because the current version of QS is 7.0.  I can

send that to you if you give me your registration number.



Version 7.0 of Actual should be out by the end of August.  It will include

8.0 of the QS library, with any luck.



Please, please, please don't send me mail about bugs in Actual.  Our

customer support person can be reached at albemuth@gorgo.valis.com, but

he does not read net mail frequently, because he can't figure out "mail".



Good luck.

I have been playing Actual with the old Cybertime library 

version 6.5 for some time now.  It's really getting to be a 

pain because my Hypertime Priority is stuck at a whopping 83%, 

and I can't find the Gateway Guardian to insert a multiplexor 

into the Celion preprocessor unit in order to bring it down to 

a normal level.  At first I thought this was a Feature, but 

now I realize that I'm just down a couple versions.  Anybody 

care to mail me some updates?



Btw, I would spend more time trying to finally reach the Optimizer

Complex (I've been at it for more than two weeks straight now),

but unfortunately my sysop has been entering through the NICE

portal and has been tagging me for some ChronStop units which 

I managed to nab while I was down in the Omaticron System.  

Hee hee hee! Still, if anyone has got past this point, I'd 

sure like to know.



Thanks for the attention.

As I guessed earlier, Actual seems to be a hoax -- but it is a great hoax.  I

know some of us might get a little peeved at those who pull our collective

leg, but this was not only harmless, but downright inspired.  To paraphrase the

original poster, alias "David M. Brown", I must compliment him on not only

a very clever faux game, but a genuine net-work of art.



After all, programming games is easy -- you just move your fingers on the old

keyboard.  But thinking up such a stimulating and absorbing set of game

concepts as he/she/them/it did is much more of a challenge, don't you think?

Why, look how fast those Actual hint requests got our attention!  Why, we were

on him like a poundful of playful puppies!



What I'd like is for this hoax to kick off a veritable tsunami of supergame

brainstorming for real.  With such a kick in the seat of our pants, some of us

game writers could very well get motivated enough to actually actuate Actual!



Come on now, we've got plenty of bright boys and girls out there -- I can hear

you breeding!  All we need is to collect some more ideas, start some volunteers

coding -- you college students don't have anything important to do -- and we

could actually release Actual 1.0 in, say, 1st quarter 1989.



Let the conceptualizing begin!

Though the actual details of the game "Actual" (pun most definately intended)

are -- at best -- a bit vague, some of the realted concepts tossed about

in connection with the supposed game are much less so. I agree, there is

certainly plenty of fertile ground here for the imagination. Though I think

that programs designed by committee are doomed to failure (or at best

mediocrity), avid discussion of the various realated topics can only

serve to aide those who do undertake implement the ideas.



Here, let me toss out an idea that has been floating around in my mind

recently. I have been mulling over the possibility of a space exploration

and planetary development game in which there is a one-to-one mapping

of solar systems to host machines (or more likely -- domains). Each domain

would be responsible for maintaining the database of information about it's

solar system and would coordinate with a Master Server somewhere concerning

various shared data. I perceive at least two levels of play in such a game

construct. At the most abstract level, which would be handled exclusively

by the Master Server, one might include such things as interstelar travel

and the perils found therein. Most definately, the Master Server should allow

hooks for seperate and divergent technologies from various areas of the

galaxy. The Master Server would also be required to impose limits and



The Domain Servers could be locally developed programs that conform to

a standard imposed by the Master Server. In this sense, they might be seen

as clients, with respect to the Master Server. However, their functionality

suggests that of a server. Various forms of client programs could be developed

to make use of the database of information about the local solar system

maintained by the Domain Server. The amount and depth of information that

any particular Domain maintains is up to the site. There will be a minimal

amount of information that will be maintained by the Master Server for each

Solar System. Beyond that, it is up to the implementers at that site.



that such a game system would be best implemented as one in which players

control a number of entities, for which they issue orders that are processed

on a regular basis either by the Master Server or the Domain Server depending

upon which scale the entity exists. For instance, the Master Server might

reasonably be expected to know only about those entites which can traverse

deep space. This would include -- for the most part -- Interstellar space

vehicles and solar systems. Players at this level of the game would be

concerned largely with travel, exploration, fleet battles and attacks on

enemy planets. One implementation of the local Domain Server might be fairly

robust and include a wide variety of entities necissary for running a

tactical diplomacy game, wherein the various factions vie for power and

control of the various planetary resources available in that solar system.



These are just a few ideas that i would like to pass around and open discussion

on. If anyone has any comments or constructive criticisms, i welcome them.

If there is anyone who would like to help me implement some of these ideas,

i would definately like to talk to you.

Mark,



Really programming something like Actual sounds like an amazing

idea.  I have been working on pieces of something like it for years.

Alas, my net.node just got net access and our postnews does not seem

to post beyond our node.  So, I thought I'd email this to you.

If you think it's worthwhile, I'd appreciate it if you would repost

to rec.games.programmer.



A statement of what we are trying to do: Write a program that

simulates the evolution of a large number of star systems,

showing the development of intelligent life, invention of culture,

and inter-relationships of interstellar civilizations.  Key points

are the variety of lifeforms, differing rates and types of technological

development, and a variety of interaction modes for alien contacts.

The resulting program would be something you would sit back and

watch, like the Scientific American game Life.  Each simulation

timestep, the universe would get a little older.



Before firing up the simulation, a two- or three- dimensional

grid should be set up and filled with stars.  Some details on

each star must be generated.  If we have a small universe or a

huge amount of storage space, we can generate a lot of details

on each star's planets, etc. beforehand; minimally, we just need

to give the stars positions.



At each timestep, we check to see if any new intelligent life

forms (ILFs) appear, and if so we detail them.  We follow the

cultural evolution of the existing ILFs.  If there are any starfaring

ILFs we determine what new stars their sphere of influence reaches

and detail those star systems.  If they contact an ILF they have not

contacted before, detail the encounter.



Some interesting possibilities - a very old culture that develops

intellectually but not technologically, never leaving its planet,

contacted by a young, expansionistic race.  A race that developed

an obscenely high tech level and then died out, leaving artifacts

for younger races to find.  Two races based on completely different

biologies whose spheres of influence overlap for millenia before

they each realize the other is intelligent.  And so on - the

possibilities are endless, and one of the beautiful things about

the program is that you can just watch it to find new, neat

combinations nobody has already written SF books about.

My basic method for generating fractal landscapes is just like yours with 
one difference.  Instead of multiplying by the length of the line, I start
my program with a z-range value.  On each iteration, I halve that and use
it for the multiplier.  I also set the four corners to random values instead
of fixing them at 0.  It produces much more interesting landscapes.

You also mentioned using some method to "smooth" the surface.  One method
I use that I lifted straight from Mandelbrot's "The Fractal Geometry of 
Nature" follows:

	After the landscape has been generated, and before it has been
	drawn, cube each z value in the array (you can square it, but you
	will lose the sign of the number) and divide by some large value
	to bring these values back into reasonable ranges.

This step tends to smooth out locations close to sea level (which I always
set to zero), while making mountains more craggy, and sea valleys steeper.
The modification is truly impressive...

A method I generated on my own to erode the scenery is quite slow, but very
realistic when you went through many iterations:

	With each cell in the array, perform the following:
	a)	Calculate the norm (perpendicular vector) to the cell.
	b)	Find the cell in the array that is closest (on the plane)
		to the direction that norm points in.
	c)	Find the difference in heights between the two cells.  Divide
		by some "constant of erosion."
	d)	Record in a secondary array of the same size as the first, that
		the first cell's height should be lowered by the result of (c),
		and the second cell's height should be raised by the result
		of (c).
	When this has been done to each cell in turn, update each cell by
	the values stored in the second array.  The whole procedure can be
	repeated as much as is desired.  For added realism, you can use another
	array of "cohesion" bands.  In step (c), the difference in heights 
	is divided by the cohesion value for the height of that cell before
	(or after) being divided by the erosion constant.  This way, some
	heights will erode faster than others, reflecting a crude form
	of stratification.  This stratification can be further improved by
	using another two-dimensional array (of the same size as the first)
	into which the original (pre-erosion) landscape is copied.  The 
	height values in this copy are subtracted from the height of the
	original cell before looking up the cohesion of that altitude.  This
	permits the stratifications to be wrinkled, instead of simple plains
	(which is never the case).

I can continue to improve on the method (vegetation, stratification independent
of the original terrain, etc.) but down this path leads madness (and a thesis).

Summary of discussion on the unofficial "Universe Simulation" mailing list,
Sept 8 - Sept 13:

Josh Siegal has established an anonymous ftp account for our archives
  at hc.dspo.gov (or dspo.dspo.gov or 192.12.184.4).  As of 8 Sept, the
  directory pub/usml contains all the source code we have received as
  well as copies of all the relevant messages.  Thanks Josh!
Andy Sheppard (convex!sheppard@uunet.uu.net) mailed us some programs
  that generate star systems using a mixture of ideas from the ICE SFRPG
  "Future Law / Tech Law", Steve Jackson Games "GURPS Space" and his
  own research.  It's written in C; here is one planet from a sample
  system: 3.  radius 17.46 AU,  ecosphere planet; length of year 192.96 EU
  length of day 36 hours; diameter 0.68 EU; surface gravity 0.60 G
  density 0.80 EU (4.40),  composition low-iron; industrial metals plentiful
  light metals plentiful; organics plentiful; small moons 1
  axial tilt 12 degrees (minor seasonal effects)
  terrain - mountainous/volcanic
  atmosphere - plethora of toxic trace metals and gases
Dave Allen (davea@vlsi.ll.mit.edu, hey that's me!) described some
  attempts I'm making towards a tectonic simulator.  The goal is a
  program which is fun to watch; you start it up and it does an animation
  of a randomly-generated planet, showing how its continents drift.  I'd
  like it to have a number of parameters so that it could be run for
  planets like earth - parameters such as fraction of water, planet size,
  and so on.  Right now there's no worthwhile code, and I'm in the
  process of experimenting with a new algorithm and writing some
  code to make rigid plates move on spheres without distortion.
Eric Haines wrote to describe a prepackaged routine available through
  the net to make fractal mountains.  It's a pre-packaged database
  generator intended to benchmark ray tracing algorithms and machines.
  To get it, send a one-line message to netlib@anl-mcs.arpa, saying
  "Send Haines from Graphics".  That msg will be read by computer.
Bruce Stephens (bruces@marque.mu.edu) summarized the algorithm
  he uses to draw single fractal mountains.  Darren Senn
(sinster@ucscb.ucsc.edu) suggested a smoothing method for
  fractal mountains and described an iterative method for simulating
  erosion by raising and lowering adjacent triangles in the mountain.

 A real toughie when it's sci-fi. I ran Traveller a *long* time ago and
found it incredibly hard to come up with original ideas about more than a
few planets.
 Barest detail for a fantasy world is easier. I will give fact sheets to
players according to their knowledge skills but all players will have
some common knowledge (basic religion, economics, social structure). The
point is, I find it easier to write a little and then have a campaign 
questions and answers session (makes for a relaxed evening :-) before
the campaign kicks off the following week.
 Back to 'Universe Simulation', I would answer by saying it should really
depend on the intended use. For our Tuesday group a little among friends
is fine and the system seems to work. If the scope is to be further then
I forsee *major* problems.
 I would always go for the kind of detail which will give a good impression
of the feel of the world, a style and atmosphere that players can get into.
An example would be say architectural styles, music, social nuances...
 I realise I'm being very vague but I hope this answers you some of the
way,
Paul (the other one)

p.s.  I'd be very interested in how your group does things.

Subject: My Interest in the Mailing List
Status: R


	Since others have gotten the ball rolling (and Jim did request it)
I guess I should let others know my interests.

	I joined the mailing list to gain some ideas for the generation of
maps, primarily for fantasy gaming.  By seeing what other people think, and
commenting on it, I get a better picture of what I think.  This mailing list
serves me as a place to put forward my (feeble) theories, and then get some
response, letting me know where I need to strengthen my knowledge.  I have
an admittedly weak background in anything to do with this list, but I don't
expect to make some ground-breaking discovery.  (One course in Anthropology,
some elementary school experience with predicting the weather, and an 
interest in the way things work).

	When Jim posted his list of people interested in certain sub-groups,
he listed me in the climatology discussion.  While I am interested in that,
I am slightly more interested in the discussion of the rise and fall of
nations, beginning from 'hunter-gatherers.'  In a world with magic, what
would the ramifications of a single spell be on a tribe of hunter-gatherers.
(Low level of course.  Imagine a caveman with fireball capabilities:
	Caveman 1:  We need a fire.
	Caveman 2:  Yeah.  But how.
Fireball Caveman :  Guys, watch this.
	Fireball :  Whoosh.
Charred Caveman 1:  Maybe a fire wasn't such a good idea.
Charred Caveman 2:  Yeah, and HOW!!)

	Well, that's enough for now.

that is all that has bounced so far...

I am a node on milnet, on arpanet, and on NSFnet...

This is also the second list I have maintained and am very used to
dealing with internet addresses.  Still, I hope it will become easier
as time goes on... I have been spending about 3 hours a day for the last
3 days fixing messages and getting things to work.

I just added:
	caa@midgard.midgard.mn.org,
	pomru@life.pawl.rpi.edu,
	kagst@unix.cis.pittsburgh.edu,
	cdr@amdcad.AMD.COM,
	dasys1!newsome@uunet.UU.NET,
	whjelmar@skat.usc.edu,
	voder!polyslo!jeff@ucbvax.berkeley.edu

to the list..

Why don't you put me in your usml-request on your machineso I get the
requests as soon as they come in.

I also put in Universe10 and Universe11 as well as Actual and the 
Shebs thing (what shuld I call it?) but I havn't removed the
mail headers yet or looked at them.
