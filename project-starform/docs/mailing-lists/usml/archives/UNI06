This actually doesn't generate the most realistic-looking map, because the
ridges generated by the first "lift" tend to stick around to later stages.
The effect is to have two large ridges (or valleys) which run horizontal and
vertical to the map coordinates, and successively smaller ones on the sides.

This effect can be hidden by increasing the relative importance of the
successive smaller lifts, but only by making the terrain extremely rough.
A better technique is described in one of Mandelbrot's books: pick a "random"
line on your square grid (randomly oriented in position and angle); raise all
the terrain to one side of your line by a small step. Repeat until well done,
subtract the same amount from all points (usually half the number of repeti-
tions). The terrain can also be run through a function to make it not all
one mountain, such as a f(i,j) = f(i,j)^3 type function.

This works even better on a sphere, where you pick a random hemisphere and
increase its radius by a small step. Repeat. If you store all of your
steps into a file separately, then you can zoom in on any particular section
of the sphere to produce a map with increased accuracy. Sea level can be
adjusted as desired to sink continents, etc.

Granted, this is a bit compute-intensive, but it does generate nice worlds,
and if you're going to generate your maps on a world, you might as well
do it right! :->

I've played with fractal methods for generating terrain and I wasn't
very impressed.  Yes, the coastlines generated are realistic and
unrecognizable.  BUT, the actual terrain elevations just don't look
like earth's surface.  They are (not surprisingly) too random.  There
are little peaks here and there.  There are no mountain ranges.  There
are no plains.   This lack of realistic terrain features is what led
me to look for plate tectonic methods.

When I get this tectonic simulator going, I'll post a description.

BTW, this stuff all looks real neat, but poses a question (often asked by
folks who play D&D and other games): How precise/accurate/believable do you
really want to get?  That's actually 3 questions, but they are obviously
extremely intertwined (I speak from having been a Dungeon Master, and from
having written a multiplayer Adventure-style game).  And here's another:
How much horsepower are you going to put behind the simulation?  The level
of simulation you can do is determined by how much horsepower you can throw
at it: 256 transputers in the same box can do orders of magnitude more real
simulation than, for instance, a 4.77 MHz 8088, or even a 20 Mhz 80386 (soon
to be the most horsepower I'll be able to throw at anything).

Also, another reference: Peter Langston's Empire game.  It does an interesting
job of "creating" worlds, including (depending on version available): iron ore
content, gold ore content, oil content, fertility, etc., per "sector", and
altitude and "water" sectors, including oceans, lakes, and rivers.  The game
takes an NxM grid (the planet), seeds a bunch of volcanoes, makes 'em grow,
lets it rain on 'em, and when the water level has reached the right height,
carves the rivers, and is done.  There are only 3 sorts of sectors after the
creation: water, land, and mountain.

	That's all for now,

If you think I could help you with converting the bare facts and such that the
tables would create into a more interesting format (what I assume you mean by
"translate whatever into a manual version"), then I'd be happy to help.  Or I'd
also be happy to help with writing up all the tables in a nice looking and
easily readable format (another possible meaning of "manual")...  Or whatever.

Please send me what information has already been discussed here...  Thanks!

Hmm.  I don't really know that much about paths...
c60c-3ax@wolf.Berkeley.EDU is all I can think of.  The path in the "To" seems
virtually incomphrehensible.

Well, I've sent mail to Jim Merrit and hopefully he'll update me on what's been
going on.  It would be neat if a computer game could be made that would create
a unique universe upon demand, scatter mini-adventures and quests and treasure
(or alien artifacts, derelict starships, and alien races, if you prefer), and
let the player jump in and role-play (hopefully in more ways than "You alien,
me shoot").

I don't know if this is what you are talking about or not, but here goes.

I am in the process of writing a star system generation program based on the
Traveller/MegaTraveller role-playing game.  In this system almost everyting is
random by die rolls.  The system takes into account spectral class (O,B,G,F etc
) size, number of planets/asteroid belts, orbits of the above, as well as sever
al other things.  The world generator includes size, atmosphere density (includ
es exotic atmospheres), population, type of government, tech level, trade class
ifications (industrial, agricultural, etc), and other items.

Is this the kind of thing you are looking for?  As I said I took everything
straight from the MegaTraveller books.  The world generator is mainly
completed ( just cosmetic additions), but the system generator is nowhere near
runable yet.

If you are interested, let me know.  I'm sure we can work something out.

BTW the program is written on IBM PS/2 in Turbo Pascal.

How realistic, and how in-depth are you talking about?  If you wan't complete
realism in the simulation/generator, then I can't be of too much help, but if
you're willing to take some shortcuts, I would be more than willing to help
with my fractal planet generator.  I'm also working on some 
erosion/precipitation code for objects of unspecified shape (that's un-
specified at compile-time).

If you want as close to reality as today's present sciences allows, then
I'm afraid my usefullness wanes.  I know diddly squat about astronomy (with
the exception of the physics of astronomical bodies).  I'm mostly a physicist,
so don't ask me about most biology, sociology, astronomy, etc. topics.  My
erosion/precipitation routines DO reflect reality to as large an extent as
I can without determining the molecular structure of the object; they assume
uniformly-sized spherical particles.

Well, I'm starting to ramble.  If you want my help, I'm more than willing.

I hope this makes it to you OK.  It's my first real attempt at
deciphering UNIX paths.  If I'm reading this right, that

aplvax!att.arpa!cbnews.att.com!elk

should just be reversed and massaged to get me a path back to you.

But, on to business, Yes, I would like a copy of what you have
so far.  I've written up a slightly modified version of that
fractal landscape algorithm for flat maps, in case anyone doesn't
already have it.  (I smooth things out a bit, so the surface
isn't quite so rough, but that's just so I can represent it on
my screen.)
