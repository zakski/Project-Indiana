Subject: History Generation
Status: RO


I'm uncomfortable with the notion of a history generator which just
makes random selections from some table of events.  History isn't like
that.  When you talk about a given event in human history, you can
always answer the question ``WHY?''  Sometimes the answers are
complex, and sometimes we don't like the answers, but the answers are
almost always there.  I'm not a historian, so I'll resist the urge to
provide an example here.

I would like to be able to explain the development of society on a
particular world. One intuitively appealing a approach would be to
attempt to formulate a (finite) set of cause-effect pairs which
attempt to capture some notion of human development.  A model to think
about is the computer simulation ``LIFE'', in which a very small set
of rules governing the creation and destruction of neighboring cells
can construct some very fantastic ``societies''.  It is important to note
that the only ``random'' occurence is the seed (i.e., the initial
configuration of the cells).  From that point on, everything proceeds
according to the laws of LIFE.

Now, couldn't we do something like this for history/politics in world
development?  What sorts of events influence society?

Example: MIGRATION is a fairly major event in a society. What
causes it?  STARVATION, brought on by sever and prolonged DROUGHT is
one cause.  DEPLETION of natural resources upon which a society
depends for goods is another.  Fleeing ENEMIES, when threatened with
destruction is a third.  Other major events might be EXPANSION, WAR,
DECLINE, EXTINCTION, MERGE, ECONOMIC COLLAPSE, to name a few.

It is intersting to note that the relationship sketched out above for
MIGRATION is as valid for mid-evil society as it is for a futuristic
society (it could be used to explain why a society would abandon one
planet in favor of another just as easily as it explains why a city
would be abandoned), which is a little surprising.  It implies that
there may be a set of fundamental relationships which transcend the
technological/intellectual development level of the particular
society.  It's something to think about.

These relationships would also have to capture the effects of
geological occurrences on a society (EARTHQUAKES along fault lines,
VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS in plate subduction zones, HURRICANES/TORNADOS
according to the weather patterns, etc.), and also would incorporate
geopolitics (trade routes governed by geographical proximity and
availability, alliances, subversion?).  I may be going off the deep
end a little, so I had better stop.

I'm mostly interested in using this stuff for generating worlds for SFRP
and FRP games.  My primary interest is in map and climate generation,
since I'd rather do the life and history parts by hand.

I have a strong interest in astronomy, and a moderate amount of
knowledge in all the earth sciences, although I'm certainly not an
expert in any of them.  Some of the material in the universe-generation
section of GURPS Space came from me, especially the tables relating to
star generation.  (There are a couple minor flaws in these that were too
picky to fix, BTW -- sometime I'll try to get around to posting the
correct info here.)

My background is mostly in computer software/hardware, generally
concentrating on system tools.  I'm now working on graphical
debugging/monitoring techniques.  I have access to some fairly powerful
parallel machines here at BBN ACI (a 32- and a 128-processor GP1000), so
I can handle running some real piggy programs, if they're C-Unix
compatible and can be parallellized relatively easily.  I'm especially
interested in the planet formation simulations and the terrain
generation algorithms.  Unfortunately, I don't have the time right now
to do much significant hacking on all this.

I wouldn't mind.  However, having proposed two newsgroups, both of which
failed, I advise that whoever formally proposes the group have a goodly
amount of free time (e.g., the amount of time one would normally spend
reading talk.politics.misc every day).  Not to mention a bit of disk
space.  And a little tolerance for drudgery.

Well, maybe it's not that bad.

The Club of Rome, with their World Model, did a lot along these lines.  Their
model was very linearized & interpolated along very questionable (or humerous,
depending) lines and of debatable use as a predictor, but it would probably
be workable here.  Recommend glancing at some of the other references I posted -
some are relevant.  Do the gamers we have here have some high-correlation /
casuality relations we could archive?

I suppose I should introduce myself, too...

Many, many moons ago, I was a DM for an AD&D game for a couple years,
leading two or three friends through overpriced TSR modules and a few
crude dungeons of my own design.  (You know, the good old-fashioned
monster hotels.)  We all enjoyed it, but ever since then, I haven't had
the Copious Free Time to run another campaign.

I would like, someday, to run an FRPG campaign (not D&D, possibly
Fantasy Hero), with a heavy emphasis on role-playing and frequent city
or political adventures.  Because I'm a perfectionist, I want to have a
lot of the geographical, cultural, and political context in place before
dropping in the characters.

So, my interests are, in rough order of importance:

The effects of occasional magic on all the below topics.
Economics, from the international to village levels.
Structures
How game countries would maneuver against each other, or get caught in
  the middle.
Geography with plate tectonics.
City design (geography, economics, government, culture...).
Meteorology.
Designing an interesting game astrology system.
Anything else on a planetary scale or smaller.

I won't have time for contributing much, especially in the way of real
programs, but I might be able to provide an occasional reference or
speculation to someone else's publications.

Good luck.

For those of you following this discussion who are particularly interested
in finding or developing consistant and minutely detailed worlds as 
backdrops to existing or planned FRP campaigns, i strongly recommend that
you take a look at the Harn system. The Lythia module -- in particular --
contains a large number of layered maps detailing various aspects of that
particular planet. Though i don't have the maps here with me now, i do recall
maps pertaining to tectonic plates, major ocean and air currents, languages
and language families, vegetation, topographics, political amoung others. 
Also included are star charts of the northern and southern hemisphere -- as
well as astrological constellations. I have been using the Harn modules in my
existing campaign for over three years now.

Subject: empire world creation
Status: RO

I recall seeing a question about how empire generates its world, but I don't
recall seeing an answer.  I meant to answer it then, but got sidetracked.  I
hope this is sufficient to answer the question....

Let me start with the caveat that I am speaking of Peter Langston's UNIX empire
game, not the one that is more familiar to PC users.  Further, the last version
that I've actively played with is a relatively old version (square grid, not
hex, for those "in the know").  I believe the technique is the same in the
newer versions, though I have not looked at the version from ucbvax (yet).

The technique is very simple:

	Start with a rectangular "flat" surface (wraps on each edge) of
	"sectors" all at elevation 0.

	Randomly seed volcanoes (# based on area of the world).

	Erupt them, and propagate the elevation changes based on the lava
	flows.

	Now, make it rain.

	Allow the water to carve rivers (# based on world area).

	When done, normalize the elevations to an arbitrary "sea level", and
	create 3 types of sectors:
		"-" wilderness
		"^" mountain
		"." water (river/sea/ocean)

Two types of mineral ores are also seeded (I *said* it was an old version!),
iron and gold, but I don't recall the rules for seeding them.

All pretty simple stuff, and the result is usually interesting.

Subject: History generation
Status: RO

Something to consider here-historians, sociologists, anthropologists, etc,
can't make solid predictions about human future history.  Even given a 
relatively small group, predictions are very difficult to make.  Human
societies are too complex for current models and theories to grasp in
any sort of completeness.  Societal changes happen for a variety of reasons,
some external, some internal.  Pressures on a society may spark change
or change may be moderately random, ala genetic drift.  Put simply, we
don't know enough about the dynamics of human societies to really do
any sort of comprehensive analysis.  So, how do you simulate it when
you can't understand it?  

What this is leading to is this:  we don't really have to simulate human
history from the inside out, we can do it from the outside in.  As
long as the result "feels" real, whether the algorithm corresponds to reality
is of little consequence.  Our understanding of human societies isn't
sophisticated enough to say "that model isn't the way it works", except
in a very general sort of way, however, our intuitive feel for how 
societies work IS fairly good.  Certainly it's biased by which societies
we live in, but what we're really after is something that generates and
interesting history which "feels" right.

indeed!

I was going to post to the guy who talked of not being able to model the
history.. since even in small systems there are near impossible limits.

I was going to suggest the "Rockefeller option" or the "Illuminatti option"

The one that controls the history that is!!

Could you amplify on this a little?  Specifically, two points:

What is the pattern of lava flow from a volcano?  Is it just cone-
shaped?  Or is it fancier than that, with spurs, etc.  I guess
with this technique you'd rarely see coastal mountains or long, skinny
ranges, but rather big mountains near the middle of each continent.

How do the rivers run?  A simple way is to just start at a high
elevation and pick a path such that the next square is the lowest
of all the adjacent squares.  Do the rivers erode the mountains or
do they just sit there?
