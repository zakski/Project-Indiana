Great, the more people we notify about this discussion, especially

I think we're best off "unofficial" for now.  It might be good to post
small summaries to rec.games.programmer and rec.games.frp every once in a while.

This is an extremely interesting list!  Can you send me some more info
about how to find the books, eg publishers, authors, years, etc, maybe
ISBN numbers?  I doubt my library will have them, so I will have to go
through interlibrary loan, and they need all that stuff.

Well, that's too bad ... here is what I'd wish for, if I had a wish:

Suppose we had a raster map of a planet with each "pixel" (if you will)
representing, say, 100 x 100 miles of surface.  For Earth, that's about
210 pixels long (around the equator) by 70 high (south pole to north pole).
Naturally the map is not rectangular but is rather elliptical.  Each "pixel"
is either mountain, flat land, or ocean.  Let's not worry about how this
map comes into existence, though it would be really neat to use a tectonic
simulator to get it.  Assume it's just _there_.

1)  Take distance from sun, temp of sun, axial tilt and atmosphere and
produce average surface temperature.  Figure in length of day and
eccentricity of orbit to get temperature ranges by season and by day.

2)  Take the parameters in (1) along with anything else we need, eg
size of planet, and determine global atmospheric circulation.  Find the
Hadley cells, including effect of Coriolis force (i.e. prevailing wind
is not straight north-south but is offset x degrees because the planet
rotates).

3)  Given (2) determine rainfall for each pixel, taking into account rain
shadows of mountains.  We don't need an absolute figure, just high / low /
very low, etc.  That kind of thing.

4)  Given (1) and (2) determine ocean currents.  Let's not worry about how to
represent them; let's just assume we _can_.

5)  I think this is all the information we need to determine
microclimates.  Label each pixel with some of this info.  Here's
where it is probably really necessary to use some kind of data
reduction, just making sure we can generate all the info again if we
need it.

So, what do you think?  What parts of this are easy, and which are hard?
I don't really know the equations needed to do any of this, so I'm
kind of wandering in the dark.

I have a 13-page document describing the basics of a simulator for a
universe, although it is sketchy on the creation aspects, assuming that
game designers would do quite a bit themselves.  Getting the basic concepts
right is pretty hard - for instance how to do 3D models of planets, how to
track EM radiation at various frequencies, and how to handle energy/info
transfer of various sorts, without all of this requiring a building full of
Class VI machines to run reasonably.  Unfortunately, I don't have easy
access to my online copy at the moment, so I can't send it out...

I just got your LONG note.  I will read it in the next couple of days.  At the
moment I have no preference for working with any part since I have no specific
knowledge in any area.  Eventually I would like to work on the user interface
when we get that far along.  It is important to remember that you need  generic
graphics since this thing will probably get moved to multiple machines if it 
gets done, i.e.   assume the machine has line, point, circle, fill routines
and build up all the graphics from these basics.  Its important not to let the
code directly affect the graphics if you want to port this stuff.  I have some
experience with this.  I have limited access to macs, suns, and IBM RTs.  You
must also keep in mind that different systems have there home position in 
different places.

What I would like to see is just the planet evolver.  The traffic that has
run through so far is talking a lot about a universe evolver.    I think 
these two things should be two different programs.  We need to adopt a standard
method of storing planet data that can work with both programs and we need to
decided what information is important.  Someone running the universe evolver
might look at his universe and decide to get more detail on a specific planet.
(I can't see evolving each planet because that would take so long to run.)
At this point he probably knows the size, age, distence from the sun of this
planet but nothing more.  The planet evolver will have to read this in and
create the current planet from that info.  Conversely, you may have a planet
you want to put into you universe and the Universe evolver should read it in
and then update it if you move your universe forward in time.

What I picture is a program which draws the universe (or just galaxy) when 
run.  From there you can move the time forward and watch it evolve (or
backwards) or you can pick different viewing points for it.  You can also
select a solar system within a galaxy and look at it more closly.  Once you
pick a planet it should allow you to see the skys from the surface viewpoint
or you can move the planet backward and forward through out its evolution.
An important feature is the ability to save a 'picture' of the planet at some
time.  Then a second program can be run on this data file for planet 
development.  This second program is what I am really interested in for use
with ???? fantasy rpg.  The second program starts up by drawing a picture of
the planet.  From there you can view its changes at is moves forward and
backward through time, look at its sky or pick a place to further devolop.   
When you pick a section to devolop it should show you a flat map.  You should 
be able to add towns, alter the landscape, etc.  It would be nice if it gave
suggestions for town places and town names using one of the name generators.
Maybe even randomly generating likely towns (or at least realistic).
Another nice feather would be to run a name generator and allow you to chose
the names from a list of random names.  The things I would want to program 
to come up with are river paths, mountain ranges, ore deposits.  Also, I would
like to be able to alter the landscape with things like 'Drop nuclear bomb'
and 'cause eathquake' (as in the spell, what effect would it have on the
big picture).  Having it generate earthquakes and weather would be nice.
It should be obvious that I am not too concerned with the galactic picture.
I want a program to help me with pre space flight gaming.  In fact, I would 
be happy with something that simply made a type m planet and made some
continents for me complete with rivers, mountains and ore deposits.  An 
important feature is the ability to zoom in on a location so you can add more
detail.

Well... thats enough of my random thoughts...

Sounds great!  Do you have the equations on how to do this?   Again,

Thanks for the info ... I'll look them up.  I found _Simulated Worlds_

There are two followups I believe.  In the next couple of days I will
dig up and type in all of my references to this subject.

Can't wait to get it.

1) I'd like to get a fresh dump from you; I don't have anything related
to what you and pearl@aramis.rutgers.edu were discussing.

2) How about, I volunteer to post summaries; would you like to be
in charge of maintaining an archive?  What I'm thinking of is this.
You could be the person to whom everyone sends their msgs.  You could
just "cat" them together and mail them to everyone on the list,
which is so far just three people (dav@dartmouth, pearl@aramis, and me).
You could advertise the list on r.g.programmer and r.g.frp.
If you like this, I'll write something to that effect in the first
summary msg I send out.  (Of course I'll let you see it first)

Dave
