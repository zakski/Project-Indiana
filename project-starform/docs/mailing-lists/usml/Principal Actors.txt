Background:
My background is in Computer Science and role-playing games.  I've read a lot of journal articles on simulation of star systems and planetary systems.  I
corresponded with a guy in England who had coded some programs (Dole's simulator and Hart's atmosphere simulator) and played with them.

My main interest is in getting a program that generates a lot of detail about a large section of space, including populating them with interesting aliens.
This would be a background generator for a really neato computer role-playing game.

Right now I am trying various ideas related to writing a tectonic simulator.  I want to generate real-looking world maps for hundreds of worlds.  Fractals
don't make it for me because they're too random. Drawing them by hand isn't practical for hundreds of worlds.

Of Interest:
1)   ACCRETE, the planetary accretion simulator, from Dole
1a)  A modification of (1) to allow captured moons, by me
1b)  Another modification of (1) which uses the same accretion engine to produce reasonable moon systems - good matches for Jupiter and Mars, also by me

I've been GM'ing since 1981 (the first four years with AD&D, more recently with Fantasy Hero) and have designed a world which I am rather proud of. However,
I have never been very fond of the maps I made.  And so, in preparation for a new campaign I am contemplating, I decided to upgrade my maps.  My main
inspiration has been the Harn and Ivinia packages from Columbia Games.  These regional modules are incredibly detailed, highly consistent, and the maps are
*beautiful*.  I would love to have that amount of detail to my world, but have no idea where to begin!

Here are my interests.  I'm afraid they're only tangentially related to the aims of this mailing list....

Suppose that one has a landscape, either generated by simulation or drawn by hand.  What are the possible patterns of climate and weather?  Where will
deserts, rain forests, plains naturally fall? How is this affected by latitude and other temperature considerations?

Suppose that one has people on this landscape.  What are the patterns of population density to be expected?  That is, if there are x people  in a useable
land area of y, how large will the largest cities likely be?  The average towns?  How many people is too many for a given mode of life?

At what size do small local units start aggregating into larger ones? I have "nations" in my campaign world where loose aggregates of city-states might be
more reasonable, given low population densities.

I'm not interested in simulating history as such.  For me, all the interest and use in history lies in the unique, unexpected human quirks.  Mass  trends
predicatable by psychohistory are background at best.

Background:
I've joined this mailing list primarily because I am interested in the idea of a computer-created gaming universe where the computer could assume the place
of DM, possibly meshing pre-created scenes together to form a region.  To this end, I'd like to see information on creating a world (including the discussed
tectonics, climatic modeling, and city growth and spread), populating a world (this is on the more fantastic end -- potential alien races, stages of civion,
interaction between starfaring worlds and between empires on a single world, etc), and universe-to-game conversions (i.e. the average player may
not have access to the volume of information printed out from the "system" program, or such access may not be desirable -- so the computer might tell
him clues and such generated by the system information, such as "You have entered a system governed by a single brilliant blue-white giant.  Your sensors
indicate the presence of six planets orbiting the star system...").

I can't bring too much to this group because I am still relatively uneducated compared to doctorates and professionls -- I am a sophomore at U.C. Berkeley
and plan to enter Computer Science as a major.  I've read a lot of science fiction and played a lot of computer games (I have little experience with RPGs
in face-to-face play, however)...

me know where I need to strengthen my knowledge.  I have an admittedly weak background in anything to do with this list, but I don't expect to make some
ground-breaking discovery.  (One course in Anthropology, some elementary school experience with predicting the weather, and an interest in the way things work).

	When Jim posted his list of people interested in certain sub-groups, he listed me in the climatology discussion.  While I am interested in that, I am
slightly more interested in the discussion of the rise and fall of nations, beginning from 'hunter-gatherers.'  In a world with magic, what would the
ramifications of a single spell be on a tribe of hunter-gatherers. (Low level of course.  Imagine a caveman with fireball capabilities:

Background:
Many, many moons ago, I was a DM for an AD&D game for a couple years, leading two or three friends through overpriced TSR modules and a few crude dungeons
of my own design.  (You know, the good old-fashioned monster hotels.)  We all enjoyed it, but ever since then, I haven't had the Copious Free Time to run
another campaign.

I would like, someday, to run an FRPG campaign (not D&D, possibly Fantasy Hero), with a heavy emphasis on role-playing and frequent city or political
adventures.  Because I'm a perfectionist, I want to have a lot of the geographical, cultural, and political context in place before dropping in the characters.

So, my interests are, in rough order of importance:

The effects of occasional magic on all the below topics.
Economics, from the international to village levels.
Structures
How game countries would maneuver against each other, or get caught in the middle.
Geography with plate tectonics.
City design (geography, economics, government, culture...).
Meteorology.
Designing an interesting game astrology system.
Anything else on a planetary scale or smaller.

I won't have time for contributing much, especially in the way of real programs, but I might be able to provide an occasional reference or speculation to
someone else's publications.

Background:
My own work lies in the fractal area, but I have been unhappy with it.  I had not thought of the plate tectonics idea, and I find that most exciting -
especially since it also helps with climate and the like, which fractals do not.  I intend to work on that, when I get some spare time (early next year, maybe).

Other interests of mine include non-normal worlds.  Tectonics would be great for planetary terrain in SF, but it is limiting in Fantasy.  Think of Diskworld
 from Pratchett's "The Light Fantastic", for example.  One of my fantasy worlds (in a manual game) was a vast plain that stretched for infinity in every
 direction.  It had no plate tectonics, and was essentially static, although similar in detail to a "normal" landscape (this universe was based on certain
 medieval concepts of Earth, "logicalized" into a playable gamescape. Its internal logic permitted such flights of fantasy as flying up to the sun (which was a
ball of fire a few hundred feet in diameter) and examining it - even at night when it was "out"!)

For these, fractals offer the only real hope, I think, though I am unhappy with most of the algorithms I have.  Generating the surface (and seas) is
relatively easy - translating THAT into stands of trees, plains, etc. (ie FEATURES of terrain) is not.

How does EMPIRE do it?  I have never seen a listing of that game, but it seems to generate some plausible-looking maps.

this fall on weather and climate, so in the future I may be able to contribute something.

Something that would be useful to me, although I can't imagine how it could be done, would be a history generator.  It seems most fantasy worlds have thousands
of years history behind them.  That is a lot of time to account for by hand! (Science fiction worlds tend to have short histories:  Planet colonized in year
x, resources heavily exploted since then, rebels now trying to take over. 1/2 ;-) )  Perhaps a standard random event generator could be used, but something
tells me that the events wouldn't "hang together" as well as "real history" does.  Any suggestions, ideas?

Finally, what exactly is "geopolitics"?  The generation of policical boundaries based on geography?

Background:
My primary goal is to develop a simulated world that a person/player can walk through and SEE. the person should not be constrained to walk only in the
direction the game designer had planned, following a narrow well defined path through a nebulous world.

To achieve this you need to be able to generate topography and plant life.  From topography comes a need for (probably) tectonics, weather patterns, erosion
and probably more. Plant life requires climate, soil conditions, insect life. Climate & erosion depend on plant life. You probably could  make a really
twisted dependency graph out of just the first two dozen factors...

Since I'd like to get something running in my current incarnation, I'm probably interested in focusing on the basic geography & climate. Let's say aiming for
 for a program which will provide topographical maps, (including placing bodies of water), temperature & rainfall information.

If we have someone around with an interest in Grand Designs, an overall structure for all of the various pieces that people are interested in building
might be very useful. The general idea being that a topography and climate system could be designed to accept as input certain parameters from a solar system
 gereration routine, and pass on its information as output to somone interested in plant life (Several steps down the pipe come sociology and civilization -
 that's the HARD stuff.)

My background is in computer science, science fiction and role-playing games. I'd like to find a way to combine the three...

I have a strong interest in astronomy, and a moderate amount of knowledge in all the earth sciences, although I'm certainly not an expert in any of them.
Some of the material in the universe-generation section of GURPS Space came from me, especially the tables relating to star generation.  (There are a couple
minor flaws in these that were too picky to fix, BTW -- sometime I'll try to get around to posting the correct info here.)

My background is mostly in computer software/hardware, generally  concentrating on system tools.  I'm now working on graphical debugging/monitoring
techniques.  I have access to some fairly powerful parallel machines here at BBN ACI (a 32- and a 128-processor GP1000), so I can handle running some real
piggy programs, if they're C-Unix  compatible and can be parallellized relatively easily.  I'm especially interested in the planet formation simulations and
the terrain generation algorithms.  Unfortunately, I don't have the time right now to do much significant hacking on all this.
