# Development Roadmap
1. Add the model simulation papers in the order that they were published
2. Add the source code in a compilable fashion to show the changes between each author/snapshot build.
3. Add zips of each snapshot for posterity
4. build a modular simulation that references each snapshot and takes the best innovations from each.
