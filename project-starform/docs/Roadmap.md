# Development Roadmap
1. Add the model simulation papers in the order that they were published
2. Tear through the Universe Simulation Mailing List (USML) data still available on the web.
   1. Track down every contributor still alive and web visible and ask politely for copies of any archived material they may still have.
   2. Use their names and their program's names to track down additional secondary sources
   3. Comb through the existing usenet archives for snapshots of their programs and their postings
3. Add the source code in a compilable fashion to show the changes between each author/snapshot build.
4. Add zips of each snapshot for posterity
5. build a modular simulation that references each snapshot and takes the best innovations from each.
