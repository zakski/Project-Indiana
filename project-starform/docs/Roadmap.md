# Development Roadmap
1. ~~Add the model simulation papers in the order that they were published~~
2. Tear through the Universe Simulation Mailing List (USML) data still available on the web.
   1. Track down every contributor still alive and web visible
        1. ~~pick out all the posters to the mailing list~~
        2. pick out all those interested in simulators + any mentions
        3. hunt down related postings and source code in rec.games.programmer, rec.games.frp, comp.sources.misc, comp.sources.games
        4. Use their names and their program's names to track down additional secondary sources
   2. Try to get in contact and see if they have any source code lying around
   3. find an archive of the blasted ftp site.
3. Add the source code in a compilable fashion to show the changes between each author/snapshot build.
4. Add zips of each snapshot for posterity
5. build a modular simulation that references each snapshot and takes the best innovations from each.

So You Know, not ambitious or anything ....
