# Development Roadmap
1. Add the model simulation papers in the order that they were published
2. Tear through the Universe Simulation Mailing List (USML) data still available on the web. 
3. Add the source code in a compilable fashion to show the changes between each author/snapshot build.
4. Add zips of each snapshot for posterity
5. build a modular simulation that references each snapshot and takes the best innovations from each.
