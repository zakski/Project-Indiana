Almost exactly treads the same ground as "Formation of Planetary Systems by Aggregation: A Computer Simulation". Except that it uses less references and you
can actually track them all down via google scholar.

reference-wise the bibtex file for this paper will be "1.5 accrete"

its main usages are as a cross-reference for refferences found in the previous paper, its comparision of a small dataset against the available accurate (for
the time) measurements of the solar system, and its slightly alternate look at some of the formula used.
