The major paper that everything before and after the accretion part of the simulation is based upon.

reference-wise the bibtex file for this paper will be "2.0 accrete"

don't bother trying to copy any text from the pdf - it will come out with garbage.

Basic Assumptions:
- 1 star of between 0.7 & 1.3 solar massses
- Planets can form between the radii 0.3 astronomical units (AU) and 50.0 AU adjusted by luminosity.

Major Limitations:
- No way to recreate the exact accretion tests results; even with a seed listed in the sample run, the age of the computer hardware he used means that
accurately recreating the pseudo-random number sequence is a tall order without the original software to hand. However unlike Dole's paper we can try to
verify the modern ecosphere code is correct by comparing the non-random functions against the sample data he provides.

- No solution for Dole's less thatn stellar Collision calculations.

- No consideration given to the accretion of satellites.

- Atmosphere decision gates and terrestrial planet composition derivations are not explained in the paper, because of this burdick and co's source code
regresses in these areas.
