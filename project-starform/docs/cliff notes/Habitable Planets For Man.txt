First Some Context:

"Habitable Planets for Man" was written at the height of the space race, a few years before the first moon landing, when it was assumed
that in the not-too-distant future human beings "will be able to travel the vast distances to other stars." The author proposed to determine on the basis of
then-current biological and cosmological knowledge whether there are other worlds where humans can survive or where human life may even now be flourishing.

Notes:

Boy its a dosey to read. Page numbers in the pdf do not match easily up to the index, but its important in terms of understanding 60's cutting edge cosmology
knowledge which the microcomputer simulations use to determine habitability.

A later book "Planets for Man" was based on this and co-authored by Assimov and Dole.
